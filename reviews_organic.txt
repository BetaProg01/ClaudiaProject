Found the spot by accident a few years before Covid and the staff was fantastic. My mom was born in Italy so there was a natural connection - we never eat Italian out and this the ONLY place me and my family will go if we go out for Italian food. The cuisine is fresh, tasty and very well presented, it‚Äôs always delicious. The people and the atmosphere really help make the experience truly phenomenal. This is one of my favorite places in New York City, from start to finish. Everything from service to food is top top notch. 
Restaurant, clean, well organised, excellent quality food, cooked by really good Italians... I recommend it to all those who want to try well-made Sicilian cuisine in New York
If you are looking for true Italian food you can‚Äôt go wrong with Piccola cucina.Every time I go is a new experience. I order the special red shrimp carpaccio that is going to be soon in the men√∫ and it was simply amazing. The ceviche was even better than last time they always use fresh ingredients, porci√≥n are perfect, atmosphere, music, good wine, clean restaurant and staff friendly and professional.Can‚Äôt wait to come back
Just delicious. Lots of locals who know this place is awesome. Truffle tagliatelle - wow! Great service, so much character - thanks guys!
Showed up for our 730pm reservation on time. Patiently waited outside in a chilly wind tunnel for 25 minutes with no follow-up. Entered to get an update and encountered zero empathy. Was seated about 5 minutes later. The crowd has deteriorated from cheerful locals to obnoxious tourists. We decided to leave. It‚Äôs too bad the food and service used to be great we‚Äôve visited this location many times over the past decade or more. Very disappointing experience.
Piccola Cucina my top choice for Italian in NYC. I am a local and it is absolutely my go-to. The pasta is the best you can get (imo) and tastes like it was literally made in Italy. Every time. The staff is all absolutely lovely too as well as the ambience. Highly recommend!!!!!
Visited NY from Los Angeles earlier this month. On Oct 14, local friends took us here. We had a great time and loved everything about it. Then on our last night in NY, we had LA friends visiting so we took them. A special night. Misha the ma√Ætre d, recognized us from the prior week and was engaging, gracious, and looked after us very well. Food-spectacular; wine-had never had Sicilian wine and he directed us to a couple of bottles which we loved; service-impeccable! And, Marco did a good job, too!Highly recommended!!
The best Pasta alla Norma I have ever had in my life! I'm from Sicily, living in NY now, I'm very picky with food... and I'm in love with Piccola Cucina Estiatorio. Emanuele and all the team are great, very professional and always with a warm smile that makes you feel at home. Sicilian wine list with some gems (drink local, always) the food is amazing, fresh, tasty, perfectly cooked and also the Tiramis√π and Cannoli alla ricotta as a dessert are perfect to complete your "Italian escape" in NYC. Can't wait to go back!ps: Team, the phrase on the wall "cucinare √® un atto d'amore" is not from Carlo Cracco but its from "Enzo Bianchi" from the beautiful book "il pane di ieri". Ciao!
This was a return visit and the anticipation was well-deserved. Every dish was a gastronomic experience to cherish. The Duetto Sandwich is hard to share but worth every morsel. Ravioli Funghi Salsiccia to die for. Cacio Pepe is a traditional Appulian dish done perfectly. Pachheri Seafood excellent. Patate Limoni and Verdure Grigliate great accompaniments. It is very noisy, but mostly from people talking and having a good time. Spontaneous dancing broke during our meal - just like dining in a local resto in southern Italy.
Delicious Souther Italian Little spot in Soho... Food is delicious with the same flavor that you would get in Italy..Pasta is al dente and the place bring you back to Italy with their music and amazing Italian Staff...Is not a turistic place is where locals go to have a great meal with friends and family.Is it quite popular so always full I suggest to make a reservation above all at night.Enjoy! Buon Appetito!
Delicious authentic Italian food ! 10/10 definitely recommend ! Everything came fresh and on time even when it was so busy. A must visit 
Good food, service, and wine. Daniloneas a great server. The service was very attentive. Very knowledgeable & always refills water glasses promptly. Super great deserts. We can for my cousins birthday and had a blast. They played music for her and made her really feel special. Amazing food. Tasted super fresh and delicious üòã
Great ambience! Food is l delicious and fresh! Highly recommend- ask for Rene. He was great and very attentive! 
My favorite place in NY! Love pasta here, always fresh and delicious! Highly recommend to try steak too, perfectly seasoned and cooked!
Danielo was amazing! He took great care of us and the food was the best! I especially enjoyed the lobster linguine and truffle pasta! The fried calamari was so crispy and fresh! The tiramisu is to die for 5/5 for service and food. 
Excellent!always good food and fresh ingredients. Staff is the best!we will be back again. Polpo is great and all the pasta amazing. Top class
The food is wonderful and fresh. The waiters are very nice. The service is fast.You should do a reservation, it‚Äôs busy.I recommend this place ! We had a great time.
Too bad there aren‚Äôt more stars to click on. As a Sicilian/Italian every time I go to an Italian restaurant I have to always settle for the close enough. Not this time at Piccola Cucina Estiatorio, 71 Thompson Street NYC. After seeing their extremely authentic Sicilian menu online I knew that it had to be the real thing. After easily reserving a table online we showed up with yes our hopes being very high. For the first time the food was everything I had hoped for. 1. Arancini: nicely crunchy and flavored. Not oily or old at all. 2. Grilled veggies: although simply presented they were really tasty and fresh.3. Involtini: out of this world. Exactly made like in my town in Sicily. A Moist, tender, flavored with some really tasty mozzarella cheese, served on a nice bed of caponata.4. Maccheroni alla Norma: finally my very favorite dish. I almost cried. Besides a fantastic pasta, rigorously cooked al dente, there was a more than generous amount of diced eggplant, obviously, with basil leaves, olive oil and everything the Mediterranean has so generously given to Sicily for thousands of years. It‚Äôs worth mentioning the more than welcome grated ‚Äúricotta salata‚Äù as a testimony to the high attention to detail of Chef Gioele. That was a dinner I will not easily forget. The last thing I want to say is that, according to the highly professional and attentive staff, almost every single ingredient in this restaurant is flown directly from Sicily including the very tasty cannoli filled with ricotta cheese. (The cheese flies frozen during shipping).Sorry for the long review. I only wanted to show my super happiness with this restaurant. ANGELO.
La Piccola Cucina Estiatorio is our first stop in New York. Chef Joelle is a master chef in italian food, The place is cozy, great wine options and extraordinary and fresh italian food. 
Food and service are at top quality!!As Sicilian I never tasted so good cannoli out of Sicily like their!! Branzino and pescespada we ate were fresh and well cooked!Well done!! We will be back again and again ‚Ä¶ 
I love eating at Piccola Cucina Estiatorio ! Great service and location, it feels like being in Sicily ! Had a new entry from the menu: Trofie pasta with calamari sauce , pesto and truffle , Tasty yummy combination! Also I enjoyed lemon potatoes. Every time I go I enjoy tasty dishes - portions are quite big ehi but my friends like eating a lot :) ! And finished with the delicious Cannoli made in Sicily and filled fresh upon serving, that makes a tasty crunchy cannoli with a fresh ricotta filling. Can never go wrong ! 
An authentic Italian restaurant in the heart of Soho! The staff and chefs are friendly and always available to satisfy your requests. The food is just excellent! I wide choice of pasta (try Fusilloni di Gragnano con scampi e burrata, rigatoni pesto and lobster ragu, tagliatelle verdi with wild board ragu and truffle.) If you love seafood, you are in the perfect place, their tartare and trio di carpaccio is fresh and really good. Desserts are unbelievable! Cannoli and the tiramisu are a must to try. My favorite restaurant in the city by far.
We had a delicious meal at this tiny restaurant in SoHo! Cinzia was our server and she was absolutely lovely. The pasta is fresh and al dente and do not pass on the gigantic pile of prociutto with fresh burrata. Heavenly! Beautiful wine list too. Definitely recommend.
We arrived on a busy 8th of March evening for my wife‚Äôs birthday dinner, though we were a bit early the staff organized a table and their overall attitude to their job was impressive. The location is small and noisy but it creates the atmosphere of NYC, we expected the place to be like that. The food was perfection. fritto misto was huge and fresh. penne al pomodoro and bucatini cacio e pepe were delicious. Bonus: tutti parlano Italiano üëåüèªü§åüèªüáÆüáπ
The perfect spot to take a date or for the whole family. Great atmosphere and even better food! Even though there are so many restaurants in NYC I would pick this one first.
5 star service and food was out of this world, really enjoyed the whole experience! Pasta was absolutely delicious you can really taste the quality and freshness as well as classical simplicity!
We went here because the restaurant was ranked number one in New York but considering the ranking we were very disappointed. The food wasn‚Äôt bad but it wasn‚Äôt good either. Flavors weren‚Äôt balanced properly. We also felt rushed by the staff. This is certainly not the best restaurant in New York.
Absolutely AMAZING pasta and grrst staff! Highly recommend the lobster green pesto pasta or the truffle butter pasta, yummie! 
We had a memorable experience at this place. I had the Green Tagliatelle with wild boar ragu and it was incredible. Danilo was our server and made sure we had the best time. He is very knowledgeable about the wine menu and all the food pairings. Highly recommend this place. 
The food was AMAZING, everything was organic and the food came in 5 minutes. The service was so good, suzan‚Äôs was an amazing waitress. She always came to check in on us and mad sure we liked everything
heard great reviews of this place before our visit to NYC. Was a great rustic Italian restaurant in the West Village; great first impression from the outside with the traditional look. Service and food were excellent; I would recommend the organic chicken! Only slight issue I would raise is the cramped tables. We were there on a Saturday night so may be busier night but felt like we were sitting on top each other and little room to move. Despite this would highly recommend!!
My friends and I love going to olio e piu because of the atmosphere and food. Especially in the summertime, all the doors are open so it's wonderfully airy and sunny. The interior is beautifully organic - all wood with tons of plants. Its a great place to people watch and also to enjoy good company. Our waitress was so sweet and gave us a wonderful dining experience. We ordered the pizza which was absolutely delicious - the crust had a nice char so there was a smoky flavor to the pizza. The lobster pasta was chewy and full of umami flavor. And the branzino was juicy and well cooked. I absolutely love coming here with my girlfriends because we feel so relaxed and they treat us so well here. I highly recommend to come here during the day so you can enjoy the great food, service, and ambience!
This restaurant is such an Italian dream come true! I came here for dinner with my boyfriend a few days, and we are still bragging about how phenomenal our experience was.First off, it was the perfect weather, and they had their doors open to sit outside. The ambiance is stunning, very nature/green and positive vibes.We both started off with the Old Cuban cocktail ($17). Expensive but worth it. It has a great kick but goes down smooth. And I love elderflower!Our appetizers - OKAY GUYS GET READY. The Bruschetta Ricotta is the best thing I've ever eaten. Period. The ricotta is so fluffy and creamy and then they drizzle truffle oil on top. We were both saying wow after every bite. I've never had anything like this and I cannot wait to go back. Then, we had a burrata, and it was FANTASTIC.For dinner, I had the margherita pizza with ricotta and my boyfriend has the mezzaluna. Both out of this world. Their pizza is doughy, warm, and soft. I loved it so much. My boyfriend had a clean plate very quickly.The service was wonderful--our server was Alex. She was very knowledgeable about the menu, friendly, and helpful. All the food came out quickly and was timed well between courses.Cannot wait to come back!!
Absolutely delectable food and drinks!! Right in the heart of the village, with great spots to loiter nearby before or after your meal. Check out Jefferson Market Garden right across the street. Beautiful dining space and bar with lots of natural light spilling in.
We stumbled upon the restaurant at lunchtime while running errands in the village. Really enjoyed the space. Charming decor and furnishings, lots of natural light coming from a big skylight. Waitstaff was friendly and attentive. Food was delicious. I had the 4 Formaggi pizza; husband had the Diavola. We split the generous Olio Caesar salad and it ranked as one of our favorite Caesar salads in memory. Would definitely recommend and return.
After a couple of years of curiosity we finally tried this exceptionally well located pizzaria+ last Sunday afternoon during a very slow period well after brunch hours.The decor, indoors and out is hardscrabble and the grab bag of furniture is likely from rummage sales or multiple grandmothers' attics. Not sure how clean the upholstered seats are. This is low investment land.After being seated indoors it took a great deaI of time to be noticed by a server. Thereafter, the service remained very slow. Friendly and apologetic when we got their attention from time-to-time, but very slow.My calimari app was absolutely tasteless, including the dipping sauce. My individual margherita pizza's taste lacked character and the too-thick crust edge was burned to inedible. Worse even, my partner's gluten-free four cheese pizza crust looked like burned cardboard, perhaps a freezer product. I felt bad for him. His nature is to not walk out on bad service or return bad food. Mine is.Something that won't return is us.What a waste of a fine location. 
This is the pest pasta I‚Äôve ever had. I‚Äôve been in NYC for three days checking out the scene to see if I‚Äôd want to move there for my masters, and up until now I didn‚Äôt want to move here. This pasta alone changed my mind. Now I‚Äôm seeing this city in a different light. I liked our waiter Victoria too. She was sweet and helped us choose what things are the best and boy were they! I love it here. If I‚Äôm ever back here this will be the first place I go!
Cheese still not over it!And cheese, she, is me! Dinner last night at Olio e Pui for a Grabbd app collab was amazing! They started us off with some bread and olives for the table. And, I got a glass of Chardonnay. For our appetizers we tried the Misticanza Insalate (baby mixed lettuce, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, fennel, provolone, and red wine vinegar) and the Bruschetta Ricotta (whipped ricotta, truffle oil, sea salt). Even though we had bread for the table, the bruschetta was a can‚Äôt miss! That truffle oil really came through pulling it all together. For our entrees, we tried the burrata and lemoncello handmade ravioli with shrimp, kale, and herbs and the margherita pizza. Both were cheesy deliciousness! Finally, for dessert we tried the tiramisu with chocolate ice cream and a Nutella calzone. The perfect ending to the night! Thanks for having us!
Very slow on service for our table & lost our order then delivered herb focaccia rather than the garlic focaccia & didn‚Äôt get my wine till halfway through entree when I reminded him, but overall everything tasted amazing and there was a great atmosphere . 
My fianc√©e and I stopped by after wandering around the West Village. We had walked by it a few times before actually stopping in. No regrets!The atmosphere was very cozy with fantastic people watching. The service was attentive without being intrusive, especially our waitress Victoria. We ordered the antipasto misto, focaccia, pesto gnocchi, and amatriciana cavatelli. All were great, but the focaccia was a standout. It's more like herbed pizza dough than the stale focaccia you normally find at restaurants. Next time I come I'll definitely try the pizza. 
We've passed this place several times in the past 10 days and were determined to try it before our trip was up. The restaurant is gorgeous from the outside, with alfresco dining with a ton of plants and flowers scattered between the tables. To be honest, bard on our experience the setting is the best thing olio e piu had going for it. First thing the food: i had the zupa di pesce (34) which was a soup filed with clams, mussels, squid and potato. The seafood was plentiful but it was let down by an overly salty broth. It also needed some fresh herbs to bring the out more flavor. hubby had the corneta di bufali pizza (24) which was more like a calzoni with sausage and meats. Whilst he enjoyed it, it definately wasnt a stand out pizza. Service was a total let down. Slow from start to finish, had to ask for a drink three times, was going to have dessert but the server took so long to return we decided not to bother. Overall a very average experience. Wouldn't return. 
The pasta and Tiramisu were truly excellent. Ive never had a softer cake in my life. The price is also surprisingly reasonable compared to other estauramts that charge the same thing. The environmental is also wonderful, definetly recommend!
It may be #3 of over 10,000 restaurants, but they are friendly and down to earth. We were flexible on time and they worked us in (same day). They also have a chef's table or you can eat at the bar. Good choices on food as well as a very reasonable wine list.
saturday night the place was packed so I was surprised that the service was as good as it was ...the waiters had to juggle quite a few tables. and they did it well............the roasted chicken if doused in the gravy(had to ask for more) was flavorful but I thought the price was a little high......the bruschetta was absolutely not what I was expecting....nice but not earth shattering....nice little pre dinner complementary olives/artichokes ...the ice cream very good........would I return? yes and might try the pizza which from what I could tell at other tables looked really good..,,, the bar area was nice and very well stocked.....i also liked the energy level ..... it felt like new york was on its way back. for covid conscious people the outdoors partitions were well done so one felt comfortable eating there....i just wouldn't order the chicken again
Booked here prior to our trip as it was No. 1 on tripadvisor and having now been I have no idea what the fuss was about. The meal was fine but nothing to write home about and definitely nothing special compared to any other restaurant. Service was average. Very average meal. I then went to the toilet before leaving which were not clean, urine over toilet seat and paper over the floor.
The food: Awful. The home made noodles are great but when served lukewarm with congealed sauce nothing can save them. The pizza....you and your pocketbook would be much better served getting a slice from literally ANYWHERE else in the city.Atmosphere: The place has put tables and chairs in every available inch. You are practically sitting on top of the table next to you. It's nice to have lights and decor but not if you don't clean them....dust everywhere and weeks old dirt on the floors.Service: Fine if you were in a race. We were rushed through ordering and paying, not a moment to spare to digest the awful food. Clearly this is a only making money off tourist rather than providing a good evening
The experience was amazing, I went by myself for brunch and the server ( Victoria ) and all the stuff were so nice to me. Her service is professional, clean and very clear. The Prosecco that I took was perfect for being outside sitting üíñ
Food was delicious!! The restaurant decoration is Italian elegant casual, clean, great environment, loved it !! And the service was superb thanks to our waiter Gabriel that gave us an excellent hospitality, not easily find in NYC‚Ä¶ overall an amazing experience!!
Wandered around after a show and saw this attractive restaurant beckoning from across the street. Warm light, clean and attractive said - "Come in sit down , have a bite or 2."It was crowded and we had no reservation, but we were able to get seated at the chef's bar without wait. Got pasta and salad, and got to watch the efficiency of the cooks as they plated meal after meal. Food quality was great, simple pasta with meat sauce was delicious and the beet salad was colorful and tasty.My only issue was the tightness of the space we had, actual table space was so small, and once seated it was difficult to get out. Also, although it is fascinating to watch the cooks, it gets very warm so close to the stove, and that can be uncomfortable.When we return I will try to do so with reservation and sit nearer to the windows.
The location didn't look like much from the outside. Your ordinary pub & restuarant down the street! It was a choice of outside or inside seating, expecting it will be little cooler with the a/c inside. The a/c wasn't cooling the area since all doors & windows where open to the outside seatings considering it was hot & humid, plus the place was packed with people. The waiters were very nice and prompt. I ordered seabas & mushroom risotto. The seabas was above average, the mushroom risotto was great but there were more mushrooms than the rice itself. The tables & seatings were tights meaning busy place and require more people to clean the tables than taking orders which wasn't the case. Had they spent few extra$$ to upggrade and facelift the venue since the food was a bit overpriced would have made a better difference. I personally do recommend this restaurant but when less busy.
My husband and I went for brunch and made a reservation the day before. The restaurant looks lively and brilliant with all its flowers and ivy on the outside. The inside is sparkling clean and there‚Äôs enough elbow room between you and the next table. The dinner menu enticed is but we could only do brunch and didn‚Äôt want to pass up eating at such a gorgeous restaurant. Host- awesome. Our server was clearly hungover- which would have been fine if he had circled back and offered to refill my husbands coffee but he didn‚Äôt. Instead we were mainly served by a female server who noticed our continuously empty glasses. Husband had a panini and I had the poached eggs with salmon. Both plates were very good but the highlight was the opener of artichoke and olives with their crisp bread. So indulging- I could have eaten 26 of those artichokes. Bloody Mary‚Äôs are made in house and had too much horseradish in it so go with the mimosa. 
1- I been in several restaurant and I can say i have the best service ever, for thous ho like a good food and hant to feel home olio e pui is a place that u need to stop.2- if u want the best server and NY city u will find this beautiful person name Alexandra she is top 10. We loved she care about people and she gives reference about few place that we had to go in NY3 - the place is clean the restroom was smelling good something that is hard to find in Manhattan. I will be back one day. Thank you for the good service guys 
I had not been to Olio e piu in a few years. I was in the area and it was dinnertime and I walked in. It is a large space, very European. I was seated and tap water arrived. i was given a menu and after some deliberation, i decided to order the abbondante personal pizza. It is a pizza composed of mozzarella, smoked mozzarella, roasted red peppers and italian sausage. The wait was not long and the pizza was delicious. The waitperson was attentive and accommodating and the restroom was clean and well maintained. Another good meal at Olio e Piu!
I really love this restaurant. Beautiful design, super clean environment, delicious food and a charming waiter Nedra with a great service! Would definitely visit again! Love it!
A nice Italian place in the Village, It is your typical sized NYC restaurant, with very nice service and a good menu. Pastas, pizzas and the like. Priced for the area. The place was clean and had a nice atmosphere
We ordered one of their amazing salads and their pasta carbonara...both were to die for. The ingredients were perfect: at the height of ripeness, clean, perfectly proportioned, etc. The place is so fun - if you have to wait (I'd recommend reservations!), they give you a bit of Italian bubbly. The servers are well supported by very nice and attentive bus people...it all was smooth, and so fun - the energy is great and the place is purely charming - so overall, it met my needs (environment) and my boyfriend's (food snob).
Olio is wonderful. Excellent location with a beautiful, clean and flowered up patio where you can sit for hours on a sunny day and people watch. We enjoyed a long lunch and hard time leaving :) From the menu we ordered the Caprese panini - mouth watering, delicious, could have eaten three more!! And pizza Boscaiola - also delicious, to die for! Very impressed with our waitress, the entire staff seemed to be doing everything to please customers and provide a unique ambiance. Definitely returning when in NYC!
Stopped for a late lunch today. First time visitors, so we decided to order a few things and share. The tagliatelle was very nice. Certainly could have been made this morning. Bolognese rage was exceptional! We had a great garlic (white) pizza that really showed off the wood/brick ovens. But, the star of the day was the Pollo al Pesto. Served on a bed of roasted potatoes with a killer pesto sauce. The plates were all wiped clean!
We loved our pasta dishes, good wine too. Would recommend the carbonara, best I‚Äôve tasted! So saucy! We shared the cannoli for dessert which was nice but wish I‚Äôd tried something else as it was a bit dry. Would recommend, lots of local people dining here which is always a good sign!
I‚Äôve been to Olio E Piu numerous times while living in NYC and it‚Äôs still one of my favorite restaurants in the city. The carbonara is top 5 in the city and the ambiance is romantic. You can expect to feel like a member of the family when you come with the old Italian gen-inspired wall art and the fresh foliage all year long. We had Maria as our waitress who was fantastic. Highly recommend for both visitors and locals. Such a gem in the city.
Local and have wanted to visit for a while, delicious fresh food, excellent wine list, fantastic service from Adam - will return!
I was craving an expresso martini üç∏ but not your typical vodka base ., i wanted jameson and after 3 fail attempts from local restaurants i found my new spot to bring friends and family! Adam the bartender was extremely helpful and made me what i asked for! The drink was delicious and satisfying., Will come again., Adam is the best
This place came up as #2 in NYC so decided to give it a go as was local to the area on our last day....was pleasantly surprised to find this little gem in a quite areaThe restaurant and decor is very welcoming and helps create an authenic ambience!The luncthime menu had a good selection and both the Bolognaise Tagiatelle and Carbonarra were exceptionalMy only small critisiscm was over starff turnaround - in the hour we were there we had 3 waiters and 2 servers and the last server took away 2 of the empty plates whilst I was still eating (we were a party of 3) - which made me feel a little ill at ease, but something that can be easiyt rectified with some internal coaching - otherwise a faultless lunch :)
Arrived at this restaurant to find it bustling and busy with a great local crowd on a Monday night! Atmosphere was fab, decor really welcoming and staff couldn‚Äôt do enough to help us. Then came the food and it was really really good. Great pasta with truffles and a pasta seafood with squid ink and chilli to die for! Thoroughly recommend.
Victoria was an amazing server! We are local New Yorkers‚Äî the food and service was great... Unpretentious yet elevated - a West Village treasure. Our main server was also really good - but Victoria was a standout‚Äî- personable, knowledgeable, welcoming and professional. We highly recommend this place - ask for Victoria!
I'm staying in the neighborhood for a few days and wanted to find something local to enjoy for dinner on my last night. I'd walked by here a few times and thought I'd try it.The restaurant is beautifuly decorated. At Victoria's reccomendation, I had the Carbonara and it was so flavorful on its own and the egg made it luscious and rich. I'd definitely come back.
Just finished up dinner with a friend. I‚Äôm a NY local and I keep coming back to this place. The atmosphere is friendly and hip, feels very comfortable and we never wait long for an outside table. Victoria, our waitress, is friendly and attentive. She knows when to check in and knows when to give time for chatting. 
our waitress was super cool and super personable definitely recommend this place to any locals or any tourists!!
It‚Äôs a while since my last Tripadviser review, almost a year ago, and I wouldn‚Äôt usually break my hiatus for a middling write up but this place got my goat. What follows comes with the exchange rate caveat. Olio e Piu is a very expensive place for what it is - a standard Italian restaurant - but as I‚Äôm visiting from a country undergoing a period of voluntary national humiliation that has murdered our currency it feels that much more eye watering than it might to locals or our luckier European neighbours. But this is a hugely popular restaurant in a prime location that served poor food.The atmosphere inside is lovely, warm and buzzing. I didn‚Äôt find the table layout particularly cramped. The waiters were efficient and accurate. Food arrived quickly. The check was on the table while we still ate. I know they like to turn tables and that‚Äôs supposed to be annoying but I find that infinitely better than struggling to catch the attention of staff who‚Äôve forgotten you after main course. None of the ‚Äúhi my name‚Äôs Sandy I‚Äôll be your server tonight‚Äù that usually embarrasses visiting Brits either. The food was sub-standard for a place where dishes are in the $20s and 30s and house wine starts at an Oslo-level $52 a bottle. The children had Pizza, swampy-wet in the centre with the tomato slick being ponded-in by a doughy rim of thick bread. Not like anything I‚Äôve ever eaten in Italy. A few had Pasta, which seemed pleasant enough but one with very chewy octopus. My pork loin was dry and badly over-cooked and smeared with what seemed to be grain mustard straight from the jar. Finally my sister‚Äôs ravioli which was hot in one place, cold in others. Microwaved? We‚Äôll give them the benefit of the doubt on that one, but the length of the menu does make one wonder.Good neighbourhood restaurants should make food that‚Äôs as good or better than what you manage at home, in a relaxing and warm setting. This place manages the relaxing setting but the food isn‚Äôt home cooking standard.
Wow! Our server was excellent. She picked every dish and we loved it. Make a reservation, this place is busy. Local Gem. Fit for foodies.
I was drawn to this resturant by how beautiful it looked online and wanted Italian food. I was blow away once I arrived. The food was amazing, wine selection phenomenal and the staff very friendly. Our server, Vitoria, was so pleasant and accommodating! Whether your visiting, or a local, would 10/10 recommend!
Absolutely love this gem of a restaurant. Consistent and delicious when we want to go out with our family and stay local. We especially love Victoria ‚Äì she always takes such great care of us!
I am not sure what I was expecting, but it wasn't this. They try to squeeze as many people as humanly possible into this restaurant, to the point that each time someone wanted to get out of their seat, we all had to move the tables out of the way, and none of us was big. I realize that space is at a premium, but this was excessive and uncomfortable.  The large crowd created lots of noise, so I gave up trying to shout to my husband over our table and just listened to the exploits of the college kids beside us (VERY close beside us. Hope everything works out with your respective relationships...). I really enjoyed my food--the mushroom ravioli and the chocolate cake--but my husband's (the bolognese and the tiramisu) were average and not worth the slightly-high price. This just wasn't a relaxing experience for either of us. If you were like us and have just a few nights in NYC, then there are a ton of other choices that would provide a standout experience. If you're a local, however, then this might be worth a shot. Maybe you'll order something really good and get lucky.
The food lived up to the hype. Our group loved the simple & fresh salads, the ragu & carbonara, semi-freddo, gelato & tiramisu. It was SUPER busy on a Saturday night when we went, so definitely make a reservation. The food was marvelous. I am gluten-free and the GF pasta was fabulous and so fresh. The wait staff was really nice and even brought me a birthday gelato with a candle. We waited forever for drinks and had to give several reminders but I think that was just due to the restaurant being so busy. I would 100% return to Olio E Piu when in NYC and would recommend it to anyone visiting!
Eating at this restaurant was a delightful experience, made even better by our attentive, hilarious server, Marria! The pappardelle and caesar salad were to die for and the burrata was super fresh! Highly recommend coming to this cozy, elegant spot in the West Village.
Obsessed with this place! The vibe is so fresh and fun. Staff is super friendly. My friend and I said we wish we had this at home so we could go all the time.
This is such a fun west village stop‚Äîfresh ingredients, original cocktails, perfect location, great service. Def will come again!
The food was fresh, with complex flavor. Halibut, Caesar, fresh pasta and salmon crudo. One dish was better than the next. Our server Marija was attentive and engaging, without being obtrusive. She made the meal even better with her suggestions. We will return to this delightful haunt in the west village.
Amazing time, and vibe was incredible. Food was very fresh, especially given the price point. Thank you so much Anela!
Came here on a casual Wednesday night, just for a quick drink with a friend. Got a seat in the bar and the vibe in here is amazing!! Buzzing and vibrant, nice music and perfect lighting! Our waiter Adam was so attentive and sweet. He suggested to add some freshly squeezed lemon in our Aperol spritz and omg it was a game changer! Definitely coming back for dinner next time - all the food coming out looks so delicious !! 
Second time visiting Olio E Piu and both times our server was Marija. She made our experience memorable and thanks to her we are becoming regulars here. Food is fresh and delicious and cocktails are top notch! Out of so many restaurants in NYC, this one is by far my favorite!Thanks Marija for providing excellent service!
This spot is very inviting! It‚Äôs a perfect place to pop in for dinner after a day in the park. Maria was our server, she was super informative about new specials and very attentive throughout our entire dinner. The pasta is fresh and the wine is crisp! 10/10‚≠êÔ∏è
Olio E Piu is exactly what the neighborhood was missing. The food was excellent, fresh and delicious. We had Maria as our server and not only was she such a delight, she was so helpful with menu suggestions / wine pairings. In addition, the host and rest of the wait staff were hospitable, lovely and fantastic. 10/10 would recommend. Run don‚Äôt walk.
Admittedly, my expectations were high for ‚ÄúOlio e Piu‚Äù. I remember this neighborhood from the late 1980s and had a few friends who lived around here in the 1990s. Speakeasies, microbrewery beer, Tower Records on Broadway & the other in Noho. My how it has changed. Ordered Pelligrino and an inexpensive Chianti to start. It was typical weekend night busy. Horns honking; people watching and walking; and, a New York pace to it all. The Insalata Di Cicordia was fresh and tasty. The balsamic vinaigrette was excellent. Prosciutto Di Parma just right. Then the Fusilli E Manzo arrived. Mind blown. Exceptional brisket in a portion that was deeply satisfying. Deserving of a top ranking in NYC. I be back again.
Came here with my boyfriend for one of our first dates and 3 years later it's just as good as the first time. The food is delicious and the service was great. Staff is super friendly and knowledgeable on the menu - they even surprised us with a birthday message on our dessert :) Can't wait to come back highly recommend for fresh yummy food and a great atmosphere!!
When you enter this trattoria, you feel like you are transported to the Mediterranean in the ‚ù§Ô∏è of Greenwich Village. Classic Italian dishes with a focus on house-made pastas, hand-stretched pizzas and more. I had their flavorful "Polipo Alla Grilla" which consisted of tasty grilled octopus, pureed cannellini beans, crushed potatoes and olives/capers. Save room for dessert. Their dark chocolate panna cotta with fresh berries was heavenly. Service was friendly and efficient.
The food was really good. Waited a good 20 minutes over the weekend. Their cocktails were sweet to me, their pastas and pizzas were amazing. Food comes out slowly because it is very fresh. Overall, I enjoyed the food and would recommend.
Excellent food, very friendly and engaged Service by the whole Team, especially by Omor and Shalim.We enjoyed this evening to the utmost. Have seen hundreds of italian restaurants all over the world but will never forget ‚ÄûOlio e Piu‚Äú.
Never disappoint. I am happy with all of the food especially the pasta. Gjokee had been really helpful with the whole experience.
Had a memorable dinner experience with my friends. We both think the food and drinks are delicious. Would highly recommend Spaghetti Carbonara. It came out so flavorful. Also a special shoutout to Maria the waitress. She made the whole evening enjoyable and cozy on this cold winter night.
My wife and I decided to go out to dinner after work. I saw the great reviews for this place and we went. Impossible to sit inside w/o a reservation. But the outside shack was quite warm and quiet. The food was excellent and the waitstaff fantastic. Faith and Shaleem made the whole experience special.
I visited this place randomly last week and was blown away by the great time that I had. It takes up the entire corner on its street and has plenty of outdoor and indoor seating. There are so many outdoor seats, it will be perfect for spring and summertime.I pass by this place quite often and I always stare at it because the outside decor is just so cute; it‚Äôs chic and rustic at the same time.The interior is just as nice and the lighting is perfect. During my visit, I chose to sit at the bar and you don‚Äôt even realize you‚Äôre sitting at the bar because the stools are just so comfortable. There‚Äôs also a big mirror hanging on the wall so you get a great view of the rest of the restaurant. I ordered the Giardino cocktail and it was delicious, definitely recommend. The biggest star was my Caesar salad, they nailed it! Caesar salad is my favorite food and the one from here is now my top choice whenever I‚Äôm craving it next. I ordered mine with chicken and it was perfectly cooked with a tasty and slight char on it. Everyone around me ordered pasta so the pasta here must be great too. I will be trying one next time!On top of everything, the bartender this night was fantastic. His name was Jason and he was just so funny and attentive. He made everyone around the whole bar laugh. He literally talked to everyone and you don‚Äôt see much of this here in NYC.When you come here, definitely ask for Jason, order the Caesar, try every single cocktail and take home a pasta. I will be coming back to make sure I try everything on the menu.
Has dinner yesterday at 7;00 pm with my whole family and food was good2 lines of criticism in order you to improve: 3 different tables of 6 guests each (we were 5) were having dinner with our coats on‚Ä¶that might make you think‚Ä¶Last but not least, the amount of the food quantities of the dishes is clearly non sufficient‚Ä¶the milanese for 36 usd is a good example, good but too small
came across this restaurant by accident with my dad and my sister. Had the most amazing italian meal which was by far the one i enjoyed most during the whole holiday, not to mention the fantastic customer service. we were served by Victoria, such a lovely girl and fantastic worker who was super engaging and kept us entertained by telling us all about her trip to ireland where we‚Äôre from!! just like the food, was the best customer service we experienced during our time in new york :)
Great food, great service in the best part of town! We stopped in for an early supper and were so pleased with the whole experience. Reservations are a must.
We have never been to this restaurant before and was definitely most pleased with both the service and food. Waiters were very accommodating ensuring our glasses were topped up the whole time. Food was fast and fresh. The ink crab linguine was amazing! The ambience very funky. Would highly recommend a visit
The food was delicious, the service was impeccable, atmosphere was great. Can't wait to go back and work my way through the whole menu!
Victoriaaaaaaa slayed our whole night! She provided the friendliest service and was perfectly appropriately attentive. The food was EXCELLENT, actually beyond excellent! So flavorful, yummmm! We had outdoor seating and the atmosphere was phenomenal what with the view and vibes. Perfect for any occasion!
I have live around the area my whole life and I have never stop here before until my wife took me here on a date and the Food was amazing !!! And Suzana was very good with recommending the different types of pastas and salads they provided.
We booked Olio e Piu for the Saturday night of a long weekend in NYC and were delighted with the whole experience. The food was delicious and the service quick, efficient and friendly. We both had pasta dishes which were some of the best I‚Äôve ever tasted, sadly we were too full for dessert. I would return and recommend 
Wow! The whole experience was great. Service, ambiance and food is amazing. Victoria made everything beyond expected. Bravo!Obrigado Victoria! 
This is my first review after leaving Lexington, MA, which I loved and miss, and settling in Toronto, ON (I assume everyone is aware this is in a different country :) ). All future reviews will focus on the great many restaurants and sights in Toronto, as well as any trips we take elsewhere, of course.We had taken a trip to New York City last winter (2018) after our international trip was miserably canceled due to an erroneous booking by a travel agent. We used to go to NYC at least once a year when we were in LexMA, and hope to continue this tradition from here in the wild north as well.We were in a hotel across the Hudson and right on it, which is a unique experience in itself, and one I will write about separately. And we were craving authentic Italian food, which we knew to be in plenty in NYC.I chose this particular one because of its unique name, as well as because of pictures of its interior, which seemed to have a Mediterranean feel to it. This is an extremely popular restaurant. We had to take a reservation rather late (around 9 PM).The experience started with the bread and immediately set our expectations high. We chose the Focaccia as an appetizer. It was delicious.For the main meal, we chose the Gnocchi, and the Linguini Nere Alla Sarda. My son's extreme passion is the culinary arts (he is still young), and he is extremely picky in his choices and can be sharply critical if the fare is not to his liking. Also, he adores Italian (I suspect, perhaps, that there is some fraction of Italian in his genes :) ). According to him the gnocchi was perfect, the way it should be.The linguini was blackened with squid ink, which was a new experience for me, I remember enjoying the dish, which has octopus, shrimp, arugula and chili flakes (every dish needs a little bit of chili flakes in my opinion :) ) very much.For dessert, we chose the torta de olio di oliva. It is an olive oil cake, if you can believe it, Simply heavenly.In the middle of the meal, the whole restaurant was shaking as if there was an earthquake. No one seemed bothered except me. Upon enquiring, it turns out that there is a subway right below. This added to the charm.My mouth was watering while writing this review. It is a restaurant I hope to return to this year, to taste some other of its delicious choices. And, by the way, Oilo e Piu means Oil and More. What a lovely name.
This place was amazing. I had the carbonara. My husband had the prosciutto pizza. I could tell he felt like he was eating something subpar but it was even better than the carbonara. It was literally the best pizza I‚Äôve ever tried. The mojitos were amazing. Best drink I‚Äôve ever had. Service was awesome. Nothing bad to say. This place was pure joy.
What a fabulous experience. We had no reservation but sat at the bar overlooking brick oven pizza making and the kitchen= pure artistry! Maria was our waitress. She was extremely attentive and personable despite the how busy she was. We watched chef Pedro Cruz smile and engage with staff while putting out tremendous dishes. The carbonara (gluten free for me) was to DIE for! My husband raved about his Fusilli E Manzo! We can‚Äôt wait to go back! See you then Maria!
My mom and I were searching for a brunch spot and we stumbled upon this place. We walked in and were greeted by a wonderfully friendly staff. Our waitress Alessandra was a pure delight. She was more than accommodating and made sure that we were completely satisfied with every course. She even recommended a delicious wine for my mom who is very particular about her wine and she ended up loving it and wanting to know the name of it so she could order it in the future. It was such a pleasant experience from start to finish. We were taken care of so nicely and we will definitely come again and I would recommend this place to all my friends and family. Just make sure to ask for Alessandra she was prompt professional and very knowledgeable.
Best carbonara I‚Äôve ever had. Everything is high quality and balanced, and the portions are perfect (though I could have eaten it all night). Not to be missed. Marijia was an amazing server!
Came here with dinner with my girlfriend. Awesome spot, food was great and their cocktails were delicious. Balanced and tasty. Maria was our server, she was really friendly and helped us with her food recommendations. We weren't sure what to pick but she suggested dishes me and gf both liked. Would recommend
My wife and I visited Olio e Piu on a Friday night at 8 o'clock together with another couple who were visiting us from Australia. The place was full and very very noisy. Everyone seemed to be shouting and we struggled to have a meaningful conversation.On the other hand, the service was prompt, friendly and the food was balanced and above average. We had an Italian sausage Pizza, a Carbonara pasta, a mushroom Risotto and an Endive Salad. All dishes were well presented and tasty. A special mention goes to Pramosia Chianti Red wine bottlevwe shared. A surprisingly rounded wine with a mellow tanin kick!In summary, I would not go to this restsurant if I wanted to ge able to have proper conversation with people accompanying me.
My friend flew in from Montreal for the week and I wanted to really show her that NYC has crazy-good food. We were walking by Greenwich village and really wanted prime Italian, Olio E Piu had a quick wait time despite being packed, we only waited about 5 minutes for a lovely table outside with flowers and cute lights surrounding us I ordered the Carbonara and oh my‚Äî it was divine! The pasta was prepared and cooked to perfection and the pork was salty, crispy, and full of flavor. The veal meatballs were packed with flavor, and my friend ordered the Nostranna Pizza, which was actually so light, but delicious. The texture of the dough complemented the texture of the prosciutto and was very well balanced. The tiramisu was TO DIE FOR. Overall it was a great experience, prices were pretty reasonable for NYC, and our hostess, Susanna was a delight!I definitely recommend if you‚Äôre in the village area!
We wandered through West Village and found this place by accident. It's got outdoor seating an a nice indoor space. The decor is eclectic and we enjoyed it. It was very busy the night we went but we were seated immediately and served in a timely fashion. The food was great - some of the best Italian we've had. The sauce was neither too acidic or too sweet - very well balanced. And the tiramisu was very good. We were not rushed and our meal was nicely paced. We enjoyed the ambiance, the food and it was a very pleasant evening.
We ordered the ricotta, salt and truffle oil bruschetta Yum! And then shared a pizza we selected the toppings for and a Caesar salad with prawns.The Caesar salad with prawns was the winner of the day, all balanced with a fantastic sauce. Sat outside in the sun and enjoyed a glass of bubbles too.
We stopped here the first time because the building is so green and welcoming on the outside. But we have continued to come back because the food is so delicious and we love the lively and quaint atmosphere. I love all of the pastas, but the carbonara is always perfectly cooked.
I can't describe how much at home I felt when I walked into this place. The pleasant ambiance, green plants in the interior, and the delicious smell from the kitchen made me feel like I had come to the right place, as if I was visiting my Italian granny's home many years later.Thanks to our waitress, Maria, we felt even more comfortable. She was very friendly and approved of our choices, so we felt confident in trying the best dishes from the menu. We ordered Tartare di Salmone and Buffalo Mozzarella, Spaghetti Carbonara and Fettuccine Tartufo, Chocolate Panna Cotta, and Cannolis, as well as Cappuccino and Macchiato. I was a bit skeptical about ordering coffee in a place other than a coffee shop as I usually don't like it, but even the coffee was great here, which is another proof that this place is very authentic and very Italian! I would personally suggest trying both pastas as they are absolutely amazing here, along with the Chocolate Panna Cotta and Macchiato.It's a nice place for a date, hanging out with friends, or a family dinner. I will definitely come back many times for many different occasions!
We arrived here on our first day in NY and were seated quickly in the early evening (happy hour!!!). We shared 2 pizzas and they were delicious with a perfect crust. The baked ricotta tart was a excellent finish. Would recommend. 
A beautiful pewter bar curls its way around one side, where you can enjoy a pre-meal drink. Its a beautiful setting with olive green walls and tasteful decorations, with beautifully laid tables. Varied Italian starters. We enjoyed the home made pasta, my wife had the Tagliatelle Bolognese which was delicious, our friend's Fusilli e Manzo equally so, and my Linguine alla Vongole was excellent. We did not have starters or dessert, but what we saw on neighbouring tables looked great. In January they have a wine half price special. Definately a repeat visit. Service was very good too.
We had the green tea and caprese. It was served with a really creamy buratta and plated nicely. Special thanks to Suzanna and Victoria , were very friendly and attentive.
I have been to this restaurant several times, and I always recommend it to friends and family. First of all, it is in a great location, easily accessible from the ABCDE lines or the 1 train. Situated right in the gayborhood, around the corner from the stonewall inn makes it perfect for a delicious meal before heading out to explore the nightlife. During the summer they have a beautiful outdoor patio, and while some may not appreiciate being directly on the streets, it is perfect to sip a glass of wine and people watch. Especially when you order one of their delicious seasonal sorbets. (They used to have a watermelon that was DIVINE.) The d√©cor in the restaurant is on point, with the entrance being surrounded by greens and flowers. They have a beautiful bar, with an open, wood fire oven that puts out some of the most delicious thin crust pizzas ever. They have an extensive list of gourmet pizzas, and they are perfect for individuals or to share. Their extensive wine list and cocktail list pairs perfectly with all of their meals, and the service is always on point.
I chose this place based on the reviews on Trip Advisor. This review is based on a 3-course dinner for one. I had a salad ($11), gnocchi with pesto ($24), and tiramisu ($12). The salad was fine, basic mixed greens with a nice house made sherry dressing. The ricotta gnocchi was very good, nice pesto with a few small bits of string bean that added some nice texture. The tiramisu was outstanding. Everyone has tiramisu but this was exceptional. Very noisy dining room. Seating in the dining room is cramped, especially if you‚Äôre seated on the front or side wall. No room to squeeze between tables without moving either table, which is very awkward when those tables are occupied. The service was fine although I had to ask for bread. And the wait for the check was uncomfortably long. Bottom line: if you‚Äôre in the area and don‚Äôt mind a noisy cramped environment, I would recommend this place, although it‚Äôs not worth going out of your way for. It‚Äôs a bit pricier compared to other restaurants in other parts of the city that have comparable food and larger portions.
Worst pizza ever had. Leaky watery and falls apart. Ich! The Ceaser salad was weak,lots of light green lettuce. Decor is cool and bar is impressive. The other reviewers liked this place, maybe lunch is not their thing.
I dined at Olio the other night because of all the good reviews on TA. VERY disappointed! We had a nice guy as a waiter, I think was from Sicily. Unfortunately he was NOT a very good waiter. SLOW to get drink orders, slow to get the drinks to the table, slow to take food order. Really did not see him much of the night. We had a party of nine so you would think he would want the tip from that big of a party. I can live with slow service on a busy night (which it was not) but I cannot accept bad food along with the slow service - not at the prices you pay for the food. ALL of our entrees came out before our appetizers. I asked him whats this? He had not comment. My Caesar salad was ANYTHING but a Caesar salad - mixed greens with peppers and some Caesar dressing poured over it. My entree,Spaghetti Carbonara was TERRIBLE!! A lump of under cooked pasta that I needed a knife to cut through - not sure where the Carbonara was on this pasta. The one highlight was the Bread and olives.
We stumbled upon this place. The little patio with the lush greens caught our attention. What a gem! We both had pizza and wine and it was perfect! Tasty. Fresh. Love the decor and the fresh flowers on the tables. I definitely would recommend!
This is a great atmospheric street side restaurant with lush green pot plants throughout, great decor, and excellent rest rooms. Great place to people watch whilst you have a lovely meal. Very pleasant and a great escape from the street even though it is right on a busy road. Fantastic.
Love it is the perfect size and taste not to big and not full of cream I am very pick for pasta and priceless for the ambiance,service I have to mentioned Diego, Marcelino, and Tush very friendly people uhmm one more things fast service and awesome decoration the green field is in your table love it .
I have been to NYC three times and have dined here four times. The sheer beauty of this restaurant first drew me in, with lush green leaves and tons of potted plants and flowers, in a lovely spot in the Village. The outdoor seating provides a great spot for people watching, and has a very welcoming atmosphere. This sets the stage for an amazing dining experience, with THE BEST PIZZA I have had in the City. Last week my cousin and I both flew in to meet up for a girly weekend in NYC. She flew in from Newcastle, England, and I from Tampa, Florida. I knew she would fall in love with the place. We were seated outdoors, and Diego was our waiter. He was so friendly and kind. He took our order promptly, paying specific attention to my cousin's dietary needs and restrictions. He allowed us to stay for a nice, long leisurely dinner, and really took our experience to the next level with his exceptional service. The pizza was perfection, as it has been every time. I adore this place and look forward to many more special evenings in NYC in the future. Thank you Diego and Olio e Piu for making our trip even more perfect! :)
I am Italian and this restaurant embarrassed me: we arrived there and with the bread we have been served sunflower oil as extra virgin olive oil (the bottle was a fake and filled with sunflower oil)- anybody can easily recognize it from the flavor and the color. After asking twice to the restaurant manager we got real olive oil (that should be green and have an intense flavor), but the "trust relationship" was compromised. In full honesty: shame on you.
Great place to stop by.pleasant atmosphere.Nenad was great bartender, good quality cocktails , big choices.Organic food. Came for brunch, recomending Boucherie Burger.
My wife and I have an annual get together with another couple and we usually pick the restaurant. We were not disappointed. I had scallops to start, followed by sole meuni√®re which was the day‚Äôs featured special. Wine list was extensive and reasonable. My wife and one of our friends had water buffalo which was a bit grisly (the nature of the beast, literally) but generally tender. For dessert a sorbet plate and tarte tatin were shared around. Noise level was moderate.
"Carpe diem, quam minimum credula postero"Seize the day, put very little trust in tomorrow- Quintus Horatius Flaccus (Horace)My pre-birthday 2019 is tomorrow which induces self-care and memorable celebration, but carpe diem everyday with cause. Delay gratification is extremely overdue. Power of one dinning alone will not sanction nor blockage my right to enjoying and living life. All I need is good quality food, drink and good customer service to color my world... and I will show you a genuine smile from within the heart. Immediately upon being seated at a table the Hispanic bus boy who emits very limited English skills, a L.E.P. person, gave me the rudest menacing scowl look and brusque for pretentious to imply why is a woman dinning alone and eating a steak. "Yeah, you want a steak? Huh? So, why are going to order a steak as a woman alone?" Intimidating maleficence dude. Are you a freak like me who frequently dine alone? This is such a negative energy exhibiting discrimination for women who dine alone. Is dinning alone a horrific crime? Too bad you cannot see the unseen for the abilities of women - see the woman that girl dinning alone could be. There is more than meets the eye, I see a bus boy with an empty soul who is unable to climb higher to further himself of a quality career. However, thankfully, my server Benal A. is knowledgeable of French cuisine and enable a good wine pairing with food which appears from his mannerism and speech he is of French ethnic background with etiquette and professionalism. This French bistro sits north of the peripheral areas of Union Square. The ambiance is average and loud from the chatter of patrons, despite no boisterously loud background music playing. Facilities are relatively clean and entrance is written in French "madame" for women and "messieurs" for men. Reservations are recommended as I booked my table via Yelp Reservations. Business card is available for grabs. Yelp mobile check-in offer is available. French baguette is provided with olives, red peppers and butter. I prefer olive oil and butter as condiments. The bill was paper clipped to Boucherie's postcard advertising 50% off all bottles of wine everyday AFTER 9 pm. The bottom of the bill embeds "suggested tip" of 18%, 20% and 22% ergo patrons do not have to calculate the arithmetic sequence.Steak Frites au Poivre $48Pat LaFrieda New York strip, four peppercorn cream sauce served with French friesThe meat was very tender and excessively juicy while the peppercorn cream sauce was a nice compliment. Since the meat was very tender it was very easy to cut into with the steak knife without applying excessive pressure. I requested my steak cooked temperature to be medium which contained excessive natural juices when cut. It was seasoned well with black peppercorn and salt. I prefer Hollandaise sauce for a authentic French approach. The French fries were a good portion size as a side dish without overpowering the lead role - the strip steak. I departed full and the steak ate my fill.Cabernet Sauvignon, Quilt Napa Valley (California) 2015, $24Medium body with a fruity nose and smooth finish as I smelled blackberry, and hazelnut. It was a delight and the intent to sipped slowly for prolong enjoyment. Disappointingly, there is NO Happy Hour available. This $24 price is for one measly glass of wine, yes baffling, this price is NOT per wine bottle.
A friend of mine told me about this place and we decided to check it out. First impressions were nice. Tall ceiling, lots of natural light, warm welcome by a hostess. We took a table by the window and ordered a few cocktails. To server's recommendation I ordered "Boucherie Old Fashioned" and loved it on the first sip! Tequila gives a beautiful touch to the drink, making it smooth and an easy drink. For my appetizer i had a stuffed quail. Being that I've never had quail before, I was surprised how tasty it is. Loved the touch of sweetness raisins give to the quail' s stuffing. For my main course I went with a classic - steak frites. It was cooked to perfection and I truly enjoyed it to the last bite. Desert time came and we decided to share a "Pistachio Bombe Glace". The semi-fredo covered with melted chocolate was an icing on a cake for our meal. Would definitely recommend and I'm looking forward to coming back to this place.
Happy to see Boucherie back in business they really done a great job on making you feel safe during these unprecedented times had our waiter Julio making us feel like things are normal explaining the menu,making us laugh... kool thing Boucherie has done is incorporating the QR menus as well as QR touchless payment options it makes it very easy to get in and get out without touching anything. About the food...what can I said we been there million times, good as always the one new thing we were happy to have was the tomato tart a delicious peace of heaven (love tomatoes) the butter-pouched leeks with herb vinaigrette was to die for great with the home made baggett of course the escargot perfect as always the nickel & nickel chardonnay was a perfect paring recomend but our waitet. overall Boucherie remains on top of the game. We will be back on the 16th for a full meal. Please wear a mask üò∑ ‚ù§
Very few restaurants will welcome you so warm like this place! We arrived at 6Pm,earlier than we booked and had a boucherie old fashioned at the bar! The restaurant start packing and by the time we sat it was mostly full! We were seated in the back and had more privacy but still the noise was high! Didn't pay attention to this, because all I cared is to get my favourite steak and to drink with friends! Tomahawk rib eye, that's it, I felt in love with it again! Red wine sauce, veal stock and herbs along with a big bone marrow! Delicious combinations! Creamed spinach was a great recommendation from Catalina! So pleased to have such a nice experience and to show.my friends that New York has the best to offer!
so delicious and health concious! filet mignon and aalmon were amazing!! tempurate taken before sitting. 
I had an amazing experience today. It was my birthday and my friends and I came here for dinner, and we had a great time. Restaurant was clean and our server ALEX was amazing! Food was great, drink were great. Overall recommend.
Always the absolute BEST at boucherie. Wouldn‚Äôt change a single thing. All plates were completely wiped clean. Best service in the city 
We had a good dinner there but the place didn‚Äôt look so clean for the c19 standards.The place looks very nice with a beautiful Christmas tree inside.The food was good. Good wine list. Good meat. The receptionist lady was spending more time on her phone than looking after the service or the clients.A director should be hire to fix the service and the global team‚Ä¶
My friends and I had a wonderful meal. We had three different orders and all were brought on time. The place was very clean. We would go there again.
We loved the food, the service and the ambiance! Every thing was clean and all wearing masks. Food was wonderful. All four had something different and we each loved it.
Excellent Restaurant!!The food was amazing and great service.Very clean and warm to eat outside. Highly recommended.Steak was perfectly to term and a variety of wines!! Great!!
Excellent The food amazing Service great Very cleanWarm to eat outside Highly recommended Menu amazing
The food here was delicious and they did a great job with the outdoor dining during Covid! The service was quick and the waitstaff took great measures to keep it clean 
I had a pleasure of dining at their original spot in West Village about a year ago, now that they have a secondary location in Gramercy Park, we went to check it out.The inside was astonishingly beautiful, just like the Boucherie at the West Village, but different feel to it. The West Village location was more like an old Victorian French. Here, it was a bit more Gothic, with the arches that made me think of historic churches. It was quite large and they had lots of seating. We had a few cocktails, which were all high quality, elegant and strong. We enjoyed them all. For food, we had Raviolis aux Champignons, P√¢tes aux Fruits de Mer for appetizer. They were both very tasty, well prepared and delicious! We savored every and each bite. The portion was pretty good too, more than enough to share. The mushroom ravioli was especially wonderful, it was so much better than I expected it to be. Then, we had Filet de B≈ìuf and Filet Mignon and Queue Homard. The steak was really good here, cooked just the way we wanted, and they were juicy, tender, packed with flavor. The sauce or the jus was really awesome, we devoured them with bread until the plates were shined off clean! We decided to end the wonderful meal with a dessert to share. We ordered Profiteroles. I was happy with the size of the dessert. It was much bigger than I thought, which was great.Our server was very nice and attentive, she took a good care of us. All the other staffs were nice too. The only thing was the second round of cocktails took a long while, but the server apologized for it and told us what was going on with that in timely manner. Overall, it was a wonderful dinner with warm and inviting atmosphere. We enjoyed everything that we ordered, both food and drinks. Their steak was packed flavor, and again, the sauce and jus was just amazing! I would love to go back again for more!
You would be absurd not to come check out this Boucherie location. It‚Äôs a cool scene, delicious food, and if you‚Äôre lucky, you will get Kenan as your server for the evening. Get the seafood tower. Such good value for the price compared to other NYC restaurants.
Very friendly staff, especially Liza! Highly recommend the braised beef and the cr√®me br√ªl√©e. Great for locals and tourists alike!
Open until midnight and true, authentic French. Fine dining with epic service and attention to detail. I started with the Escargot that came out to bubbly perfection. They were so tender and the hint of lemon was amazing. I used the table bread (which I'm certain was fresh baked that day either in house or by a local vendor (didn't ask)) to scoop them out of their little holes and soak up the garlic lemon sauce they sat in. Next was the Cesar salad which had more lemon than I am accustomed and I'm completely here for it. After having their I'm definitely upping my lemon game on the one I serve. For my main course I have the mussels and pommes frites. I haven't had a good mussel since leaving California in 1999. There was a bit too much of the white wine sauce they come which I found to be wasteful. Each mussel was tender and nearly melted on the tongue, completely delicious. The pommes had an epic crunch that can be difficult to get with something so thin, I was thoroughly impressed. They were a bit too salty at the bottom of the bowl though and I'm not sure if I'd order them again. Being a Chef/Baker I definitely didn't want the creme brulee as I make it constantly and find it boring. I'm also not the biggest fan of chocolate, and do my best to not eat American chocolate. The waiter worked with me and suggested a poached pair in a spiced wine reduction with a side of ice cream, I happily agreed. The cinnamon in the wine shined and the warmth of it with the sweet of the pair danced on my tongue. The pear was fork tender so I cut it up into smaller pieces that could be scooped with the spoon to get ice cream there as well. The warmth of the wine and cinnamon, the sweet and warm pear with the cold ice cream was the perfect finish to an amazing meal. Each course came with a few minutes in between to allow the stomach to start it's job on the previous course. I left satiated but not full because I was given that time between courses. This meal was planned because it was close within walking distance of the show I had seen. I'm so glad I napped this out and found Boucherie, it's now added as a favorite in NYC for future trips. LOL glad I come yearly.
Amazing dinner after a night out in NYC! Recommend to any locals or visitors. Extensive wine selection and French dishes to drive the pallet bonkers
A day of travel and our first meal in NYC to start off a five day stay. My spouse had never been to visit and I lived here 25 years ago. Boucherie did not disappoint, ambience was very French. Table seatings were locals and visitors alike.Wait staff was that wonderful side of professionalism and efficient at their job. Our waiter was studying to better his life and doing it the best way, New Yorkers know how. By getting the education required, but working at jobs that allow them to live in such a great city while learning. Our meal was simple bistro and would have been perfect if the steak had been cooked properly. Although the steak was overcooked, they offered to replace and yet it wasn‚Äôt necessary and did not diminish our enjoyment for the entire experience. The reservation had been made with a notation for a special occasion. A beautiful signed book with story of the chef and a complimentary dessert shared, made a perfect touch to a beautiful evening. The bone-in chicken had my wife claiming it felt like Paris in the simplicity. My steak au poivre vert was just over cooked and would have been happily replaced. Because of the long travel day and my hunger, it wasn‚Äôt necessary. Just by offering to do the right thing was enough ... thank you 
This restaurants atmosphere, accompanied by fantastic cocktails, excellent knowledgeable, service/servers, and most importantly, AMAZING cuisine is every bit worth the visit. If you have the chance order the mussels, and beef bourguignon, it is OUT OF THIS WORLD!! Our server Gabriel was exceptional, kind and attentive. The manager Christelle was so helpful, and even made arrangements for us, after dinner to have cocktails and dance at a local hot spot. I absolutely cannot suggest this restaurant enough! And will return!
Had such a wonderful dinner here at boucherie! Service was attentive and efficient. Good for either a local dinner or for a birthday! Thanks Benal!
I work in the neighborhood and take my team here regularly for after work drinks. Beautiful, open space, friendly staff and great cocktails. Recommend for locals and travelers alike! Try the Lillet rose spritz.
Our last meal on this trip to NYC was sadly not a memorable one. The service was great, but the food just average. We ordered the Comte and Brie, French onion soup, chicken main dish, and pork tenderloin. The Comte was okay, I‚Äôve had better from my local grocery store. The other food was average. If ever in Washington, D.C., go to Le Diplomate near Logan Circle.
We always enjoy this local restaurant and had a delicious lunch with family from Nebraska today, including the scrumptious profiteroles. Our server Katerina was delightful.
We visited for brunch. The atmosphere is so very French, it made us feel as we were in a Parisian bistro. Freshly baked baguette and croissants‚Ä¶flaky deliciousness! The eggs Benedict was fantastic and the service was attentive. Highly recommend
Boucherie Union Square is warm, inviting, and has a casual home feel. The food was delicious with options from land and sea. Their cocktails are fresh and creative with bursts of flavor. This wasn't our first time, but no time is ever like the last. Take a friend, a date, or yourself and make a culinary memory you won't ever forget. With love, KB
Delicious food and amazing service! We got our food quickly and it was delicious and fresh. Our server was Kenan and he was extremely nice, helpful and made us feel so welcome! We will definitely be back- best location in NYC 
Great service and great vibe! The staff was fantastic, food is always fresh, especially the seafood tower. Kenan was our server, kind and very accommodating! One of the best union square neighborhood spots. 
We had a lovely dinner. The oysters were very fresh and the steak frites was delicious. Our server, Gaudi, was knowledgeable about the wine menu and attentive to the needs of the table.
I have been to their Grand Central location first and foremost during the Winter and had a wonderful time. This time around, I visited their Union Square location for a weekend brunch and they had $17 for half a dozen oysters! With selections from both East and West Coast! They were super fresh! I paired with a pinot gris from Alsace and their specialty cocktail La Vie En Rose. Both were delicious! Their wide selection of classic French Bistro menu was great! I loved the duck confit and steak frites. And I found their portions generous. I was almost full off of the appetizers! PS: Don't miss the dessert and coffee! The chocolate tart was soooo rich in flavor! And the profiteroles with vanilla icecream and rich chocolate syrup hit the spot!
We loved Boucherie and we adored Mike! Everything was fantastic from cocktails to wine to the food. We ordered the seafood tower which was fresh and delicious. We split the salmon and mussels and loved both- especially dipping the bread in the broth from the mussels! Atmosphere was perfect for a date night- we will be back!
We had a great time celebrating the birthday of a friend. Our waiter Alessandro was efficient and super friendly. Very fresh delicious oysters, perfectly medium rare ribeye, and smiles all around. We will be back!!
I had a great dinner on a special and event full day, will definitely come back, drinks was amazing and the food so fresh great place to catch up with friends or date
We got the steak frites, mussels, mushroom ravioli, and duck leg. Duck was very tender, mussels were fresh. Superb service as well!
It was a very disappointing evening, Average at best and definitely did not live up to the reviews on TripAdvisor. We started with escargot and French onion soup, both of which were only average and the soup at Bobby Vans steakhouse in NYC was far superior. Entr√©e were duck confit leg and salmon papillote Looked quite appealing but were lacking in flavor. Even the vodka martinis were quite average. The only highlight was the fresh bread and the attentive bus boys. This restaurant is very noisy and charges fine dining prices, but with only average food and service. the hostess was surly at best. We skipped dessert assuming it would not be any better.
Celebrated my friend‚Äôs birthday at Boucherie. We started off with a delicious plate of stake tartar and steaming flavorful escargot. The steak was so fresh and tender - it literally melted in your month. I followed up by a plate duck confit. The duck was great - fatty and crunchy - on a bed of potatoes, mushrooms and a rich red wine sauce. The service was prompt and attentive and the whole experience was one to remember.
Just like coming home to my mom freshly made bread and tasting the crisp crust with the warm soft inside of the bread I think this place is a wonderful treasure. I love to walk in to get a baguette that is so soft it feels like a pillow....and the selections of jams and with butter I was back in Paris France again....its a nice venue area to walk through as well
This restaurant is a must-visit. From the food to the ambience, it's a perfect place for a true 'fancy' NYC dinner. Great for any special occasion or if you're visiting the city, it's a nice treat night for the vacay. All of the dishes are presented with such care, professionalism and detail. Everything is as impressive and beautiful as it is delicious. Don't skip the wagyu sausage - trust me. The butcher block is decadent as anything you'll ever have. You've never felt as special¬†as you will as the entire restaurant watches the chef shave fresh truffles all over your food. The mussels, the steak tartare, the ratatouille. You really can't go wrong. Unless, of course, you don't go at all.¬†
Amazing vibe feels like in France. The food is also top notch but I will vote cr√®me br√ªl√©e for my favorite!!! Soft and not too sweet texture and I‚Äôve never eaten the whole but this one is different. Food is pricy but good for the overall experience. And Emily is a very accommodating host
Great date night vibes. Food was fantastic but my date was better.Service was excellent. Was seated immediately. The wine was great and enhanced the whole meal. The gold flecks on the chocolate tart is a must. Worth every dollar. 
Came here with my boyfriend for a lovely weekday dinner and was again blown away by the experience. This is our go to French date night spot. We enjoyed escargot, Cesar salad, and the lyonnaise salad to share followed by steak frites and the steak bavette. Everything was outstanding! Our server Alessandro made the whole night that much better with his impeccable, well timed service. Overall would recommend to anyone who loves great food and great service.
We just so happened to pop into the restaurant, never dining here before and we were pleasantly surprised with how delicious the food was and quick service. Our server Martha was super friendly and answered all our questions about the menu. The busser Jose from Venezuela was polite and made our whole dining experience much more enjoyable! 
We recently stopped at Boucherie to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The food was incredible- my husband had the beef bourguignon - which was one of the best things we‚Äôve ever had...I had a beautiful dry aged steak. The frites are crisp, the mussels perfection, and a delicious pistachio bombe glac√© to finish...with whole pistachios throughout. Our server was amazing , I forget his name but a gentleman from Macedonia, he was helpful (we were having a hard time choosing!), thoughtful and attentive. I couldn‚Äôt find one thing wrong with our experience...except we ate too much! It was irresistible!
We went to the Boucherie for dinner. The food was very good, the service was great and the place is really nice. It was a very hot and humid summer NYC day and almost the whole wall was open to the street (which is nice), yet it felt very comfortable in side. We are definitely going to be coming over again. 
My husband and I dined here last Thursday night. Looking for a quiet place to dine for a good steak dinner we thought this would be nice coming from out of town. Firstly, the tables are the smallest I have ever seen. If another couple were to dine next to us it would have been even worse because we were right next to them included in their conversation. Luckily it wasn't very busy other than the eight men next to us on the other side taking instagram pictures the whole time, camera flashes oh my! We ordered an appetizer which meant they had to pull another table next to us to accommodate the extra food. Our steaks were the most unflavored and dry. Neither of us finished them. The big mirrors were the best part of the experience that was about it.
Visited NYC this June and had the chance to eat in this restaurant! A very warm, enjoyable place with many dish choices! For apps we chose foie gras, octopus and duck salami from charcuterie! Main was big and reasonable for the given price because the quality was excellent! Catalina said to try their famous Truffle burger and their most delicious NY strip stake which came with salad! I would say best visit ever!In few wordsPURE JOY!
Went to the Boucherie at Union Square and had an amazing dinner. Started with the French onion soup which had well balanced flavors. Then had the roasted chicken for an entree which was very well prepared. The service by Tatiana and her team was excellent, they were very attentive to the needs of our table. I would recommend this restaurant to friends and family!
This time I had steak and eggs. It was perfectly balanced and tasty. If you‚Äôre really hungry after long night, this is a meal for you.
Was great! Sat at the bar and Ranko helped us choose cocktails. His drinks were well balanced, and delicious!
I'm not into writing reviews, but this great new spot deserved it!Shy from outside...but stepping inside, you are hit with a passion like in a french classic movie...vintage decor, "Charcuterie", impressive bar, mirrors in a wooden frame, vintage posters...Servers look and act confident...proud to be there, giving attention and proactive all the time.D'auvergne salad, ravioli, filet mignon, steak frites...perfectly cooked and balanced taste, pistacio bombe glacee at the end fulfill our excellent and unforgettable dining experience..Coming back for sure!
The food was great and amazing service really satisfied overall. The green hour is super creative and a great way to do happy hour
This is the place to hang out if you visit New York. So much fun with my bffs. Make sure you don‚Äôt miss the green hour for an Old Fashion and a delicious cheese burger with fries. 
I totally recommend this place. I had ‚Äúgreen hour‚Äù with my friend at the bar. Joel (the Bartender) was part of our GREAT experience, such a nice person, amazing environment, delicious food and unforgettable drinks. Pistachio Bombe Glacee SO DELICIOUS!!! See you soon! 
An unplanned visit to this adorable French resto was the pleasant surprise everyone needs. We didn‚Äôt have a reservation but we scored a high top by the bar. We also lucked out that it was still Restaurant Week. The menu had enough variety to please all of us and every course was top notch. Joel was very attentive and made sure our glasses were full and our courses arrived in a timely manner. We are already planning our next trip back to enjoy the Green Hour menu and more of the absinthe cocktails!
First time at the Boucherie Union Square. The food was not only great but the service was amazing. I came for green hour / happy hour with my boyfriend. He loved the drinks, old fashion. And we tried the Beef Skewers ( yumm) Over all restaurant atmosphere is great, and our server Joel was great!!! Very attentive and he made sure we had a drink in hand all the time we were there. Great Service, food, and atmosphere. Really recommend !! 
In spite of overwhelmingly favorable reviews our experience was less than satisfactory. We opted for the traditional croque monsieur, which arrived as an overly large wad of tough bread containing rather uninspiring slices of ham and cheese. This was accompanied by a tangle of greens with a slight hint of unidentifiable dressing. Emphasis on quantity rather than quality, which seems to sadly be the direction of French cuisine these days. We should perhaps give Boucherie another chance, but are not inclined to do so...
I went to have some drinks with some friends at the Green Hour at Boucherie at Park Avenue, they have really nice drinks also German the bartender gave us an excellent service.
Came in after a work meeting that got out early with a friend and so happy I did! Stumbled into their ‚ÄúGreen Hour‚Äù which had amazing wine and food deals until 7PM. The wine was matched only by the ambiance ‚Äî I could have stayed for hours! Ranko, our server, was beyond amazing and fun. A great energy and so knowledgeable about the wines and cocktails! I will definitely be back here!
Starting with a charming facility, we enjoyed a lovely bottle of French wine, and the steak tartar which was good. The scallops entree was excellent and duck confit very good and well presented with toasts and a nice bunch of greens. Our Serbian waiter was charming and helpful and we enjoyed the complimentary glass of champagne in celebration of our anniversary. All in all a great choice for a short New York sojourn.
We came for the green hour from 6pm to 7pm. Half off burgers and mad tasty escargot. Bartender was mad decent and cool to chat with. Keep keeping it real.
Came by the other day and tried their Green hour menu. I really enjoyed their Old fashioned and Brochette, great small bites. Will definitely be back for dinner
Came for a dinner with my friends, food was great, fantastic ambience and attentive staff. Will definitely be back for Green hour
Came here for Green hour with friends, had great cocktails and small bites. Great value! will definitely be back
Stumbled upon this place one afternoon and I‚Äôm so happy I found. Cocktails are great, I had Boucherie Oldfashioned which was delicious. They also have great Green hour, I‚Äôll make sure to come back soon and try it as well
Fantastic! We wanted to visit for some time. And it was well worth the wait. The food is exquisite. Great ambience. The service was impeccable‚Äîstaff is friendly and helpful. The dinner menu is extensive and accommodated our varied tastes. And the flavors worked! I ordered seared scallops in a light tomato sauce, salad of saut√©ed Brussel Sprouts and carrots over mixed greens, and shared charcuterie platter. Ended with lamb chops cooked as requested. Excellent wine list and dessert menu. I definitely recommend Boucherie Park Avenue South. It‚Äôs well worth the trip and a wonderful addition to the food scene.
Restaurant Week lunch a few months ago was delicious. P√¢t√© en Cro√ªte with a salad and cornichons paired nicely with a glass of wine. Then Moules Frites arrived with addictive pommes frites. Bathed in wine and herbs, the mussels were plump but the sauce was bland. Service was attentive. This restaurant feels like being in Paris with the overhead old fashioned fan.
As a solo diner I was able to walk in and get seated at the bar, where I was well tended to by an authentic French waiter who had a bit of sass and a great sense of humor. I ordered the herb-de-Provence-encrusted rack of lamb, which was sizeable, and succulent when served medium, with a stellar reduction sauce, haricot verts, and baby potatoes. The dessert was tarte Tatin; the only place I've had it better was Paris---only complaint was that the portion was smallish. Even on a bar stool I was comfortable, surrounded by tasteful music, dimmed lighting, and good feelings all around. The check was very reasonable, to boot! The best meal I can recall having in New York for some time.
My partner and I had a dinner that was no less than fabulous tonight. This tiny place has one waiter and one bartender, but the service was impeccable - friendly, attentive and helpful. My partner had the chateaubriand which was perfectly cooked (just on the rare side of medium rare), tender and absolutely delicious. My scallops St. Jacques were perfectly cooked - a lighter version of the traditional coquilles St Jacques, with tomatoes, herbs and perhaps a splash of Pernod or Absinthe. Incredible. A lovely and memorable meal. 
Great service and attention to detail by our server Matthew. The Nicois salad was tasty, fresh and good start to our main course. The Beef Bourguignon was cooked over 48 hours and extremely silky and tender that each bite melted in my mouth. This dish is made with bacon with a small piece in the dish, to further enhance the rich flavor of the meat; make sure to ask them to leave it out if you have dieatry restrictions. My wife's Filet Mignon was cooked medium to perfection all around, each bite was tender and seasoned just right. We ordered a side of herb truffle fries that was crispy on the outside and warm and soft inside. Celebrating my wife's birthday they made our night memorable and even comped our fresh fruit plate and fluffy chocolate mousse. Looking forward to returning soon to try their other dishes.
Met another couple here for lunch, and couldn't be happier. Charming atmosphere, pleasant service, and the food was fabulous. I had the waffle with smoked salmon, which was delicious. My wife had eggs and smoked salmon, also great, the eggs were especially tasty. Had two orders of fries for the table, one truffle, one herbs de province. Both were perfectly cooked, although I think the truffle fries could've used a touch more truffle oil or truffle salt. Overall a wonderful experience, I'd return in a heartbeat. 
Having just returned from Paris a few months ago, my soul was still longing for that casual but always somehow elegant feeling only the French pull off so effortlessly. So when I was looking for a suitable brunch spot in New York City, near my two beloved friends, a fellow theatre buff and my theatre and film agent (both downtowners) I purposefully looked for a place that would give us intimacy, good fare, and a feeling of being transported, not that the Village itself doesn't imbue upon us a sense of being somewhere urban and wonderful. From my arrival, I intentionally arrived early-ish for Sunday brunch to avoid potential masses, about 11:00 (early for New Yorkers) and tried to lay claim to a table. None were immediately available and there were small "Reserved" note cards on one of the preferred tables by the window, so I took to the bar to await my friends, and ordered a Caf√© Latte to bide my time. The latte was nothing short of a creamy delight, and I soaked up the vibrations of the place while having an amicable chat with the manager, Chrys, who is a delightful French woman, exuding all the charm French woman pull off so effortlessly, and it was during our brief repartee, I got the crushing news that they were out of the Duck hash that had made me choose Dominique's over a couple other nearby French places. And this at the START of brunch? I must admit I was crestfallen. However, Chrys more than made up for it. Eventually my friends arrived and within moments we were given a seat window side, enjoying a mild breeze from this particularly splendid Spring morning. My agent and I had a lovely bottle of Ros√© Champagne, and my Broadway baby buddy had a latte and Eggs Benedict which of course are poached eggs, and these were served with a prosciutto cotto, and a delicious hollandaise sauce that set him back 19 bucks. My agent had the Smoked Salmon Benedict which were also poached eggs, but served with a lovely smoked salmon, and a sauce choron, for the same price. Both were delicious as my wandering fork got samples of each of my friends' plates. As for me I got the rustic in the skillet Eggs Proven√ßal which are eggs baked right into the ironclad skillet, made with fresh, local market, roasted tomatoes, fennel, and herbs de provence for 17. We all shared an exquisite Cr√®me br√ªl√©e that couldn't have been any more authentic. In the end I left feeling noursihed, both body and soul. I will have to return someday soon to get my duck hash and I will be sure to arrive on the dot when they open lest I miss out next time too.
This is a nice restaurant however , the duck leg I asked for was actually the size of a little bird - hidden with a large portion of salad !!One more comment , if you really must use a CLEAN napkin to dry the dirty floor , do not do it in front of a customer - he only thinks about the one he just used ...
My friend and I felt like having French tonight so we randomly picked this restaurant due to the positive reviews. Dominique Bistro did not disappoint. The wine selection was superb and thoughtful. I ordered the ink linguini with crab and I almost licked the plate clean. We also got the apple tart and cream br√ªl√©e and both were amazing and a perfect end to our night. We are so happy we found this place. Will definitely return and highly recommend this place to everyone!
This is a small, intimate space in the Village. It is easy to find, very very clean, and the food is incredible. You should make reservations, as there were lots of customers when we went the two nights we were in NYC. Our first dinner was incredible; yes, we came early at 5 pm so we could see a show, so the place was mostly empty, but the service was incredible. Never was there an empty plate on the table, the waitress filled the water glasses regularly and came to ask us if we needed anything just the right amount of time. The appetizer cheese platter, chef's choice, was excellent. Warm baguette served with it went well also with my husband's escargot appetizer as well. Wine list is quite varied. My duck confit was delicious, but not a large portion. We did not have dessert. We loved it so much, we had dinner here the very next night. Food, again, was simply wonderful, presentation and taste. It was busy at 8 pm. We had a table in the back, which was fine, but there is a small bar there and the 5 people sitting there were very loud. That's fine; it was a busy night. Service started out well, although we thought the young man was acting odd. He poured wine by holding it high in the air to come down into the glass! As the evening went on, the dishes on our table started piling up; we finally moved them to the empty table next to us. The bartender came and took them away. We had to go up to the bar to order another glass of wine. The waiter--nowhere to be found; We think he took a nap in the backroom! When I got up to speak to the manager, as of course we had no bill either, the waiter suddenly appeared, asking what we needed, and apologized for his absence. The manager said they would compensate on the bill and asked if we wanted a free dessert, but I said no. YET, when the bill came, no compensation or even small gesture of a discount and they DID bring a dessert. Not sure how to advise the management and not sure whether you will have a great time, but you will have a suburb dinner, so you might need to be pro-active in assuring you will have good service while enjoying the excellent french food they serve here.
We have a house in France and this was one of the best French meals we have had anywhere in the world. We loved the idea of coming down to Greenwich and the building - both inside and outside - could have been in a Woody Allen movie. Really great food - snails and lamb for me, onion soup and mussels for Nathalie - and a very good bottle of wine. Waitress Claudia was wonderful, as was waiter Ali. If we lived in New York we would make this our local.
I went here with a group of girlfriends to celebrate a birthday, and it was a perfect quintessential New York night. I‚Äôve been living in New York for many years, and I love going to Petite Boucherie, the service is always on point, the food is always delicious, and it is just the right size to feel the energy of those around you and feel the energy and personality of the village, without being overwhelming or too loud. I absolutely love the location, as it is a perfect walking distance from the subway, along with many other local attractions that make for a perfect girls night out. We loved the charcuterie board, the burger, and of course the onion soup and escargot which, in my humble opinion, are THE BEST IN THE CITY. if you‚Äôre traveling through NYC, be sure to stop here for brunch, lunch or dinner.
What's not to love. A hidden gem, located on arguably the most quaint street in the most quaint neighborhood in NYC. Embued with a frenchness that transports you to a local bistrot. Populated by a bartender, waiters and regulars that embody Cheers (as far as a "French Cheers" can get). Excellent libations and food. Be sure to say hi to Sophie and Mika and have them make your night. 
I really enjoyed our dinner. Very good service, and very good food. The sitting is fairly tight. Seemed to be a popular local restaurant. Lively atmosphere and very good waiter - sorry, I lost his name. 
a lovely local spot with good food, friendly staff and moderate prices. the lunch was perfect for my sister and me. we will be back again and again.
Visited with my husband while on holiday. We wanted to escape the tourist traps. Lovely local French restaurant. The service was amazing and the food quality was really good. The waiter who was a lovely chap recommended wine and cheese selection which both were of good standard and really authentic. The meal was one of the nicest we had whilst in New York 
Great atmosphere for a restaurant in the West Village. Lots of locals seem to come to this spot too. Portions are a little small, we shared 5 plates for 3 people, but very flavorful!
We celebrated our 45th anniversary with a weekend in NYC. Looking for a small, quiet place for our anniversary dinner, I found Petite Boucherie on TripAdvisor. Located on Christopher Street in the Village, it was just what we were looking for. Fine French food without being pretentious. Just the kind of local restaurant we loved on a trip to Paris many years ago. The setting was relaxed and friendly, the food was deliciious, and the waitstaff was gratious and helpful. When my husband was considering what to have for an after dinner drink, the waiter had the bartender come to our table to offer suggestions. He gave a detailed explanation of how absinthe is prepared, which we found very interesting, especially their beautiful absinthe fountain. It was a delightful dinner and we will return on our next trip to the city. Highly recommend!
We had a superb brunch. I had a wonderful Noicse Salad with Ahi Tuna, French Onion Soup and a crisp dry Rose. The salad was the star by far followed by the beautiful Rose. I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant. The host was friendly and informative. Looking for a great local restaurant with local flair this is it... 
Excellent restaurant with a beautiful central bar where you can have your wine with excellent choices to eat. Though very popular, the service was well worked out.
A local resturant. Yes tables are tight, but the service and ambiance are very good, as is the food. Small size says get a reservation. The food is well presented and tasteful. Really a good place for a meal and a drink.
Dominique's bistro is a lovely, small French bistro, which plays music from the 50's. The food is well prepared and delicious. Due to this bistro being quite small, I would suggest you reserve a table, especially at weekends, as it is very popular with the local people too.
We had passed this restaurant several times but hadn't tried it -- and decided to do it on impulse for lunch last Saturday, after looking at their menu on their website.The restaurant is small and doesn't look like much when you walk in -- but that is deceptive. The quality of the food, service, and hospitality was quite a pleasant surprise -- and our lunch far exceeded our expectations.Our waitress, Maya, was very gracious in guiding us through the menu and making sure everything was to our liking.Like the best local restaurants in France, the kitchen here uses traditional recipe formulations as a starting point, then puts their own innovative twist on each dish.Two of us split the Coq au Vin for a main course; it was plenty for two after appetizers. Unlike the traditional rendition of this dish I have had, which is basically chicken in a red wine stew, here it was chicken cooked crisply with fresh vegetables and pork lardons -- with a slight red wine glaze. It was positively delicious -- and would come back to order it again.Similarly, the steak tartare I had as an appetizer was very high quality, but less highly spiced than in other French restaurants. It was also delicious, as was the salad my companion ordered first.The wine list was excellent, with unusual choices at reasonable prices.Overall, this restaurant reminded me of a small neighborhood place in a remote district in Paris, rather than a mainstream French bistro in Manhattan.It was charming, and we will be back soon!
We were some friends, and had full courses. The waiter was really nice and on point and took good care of us, and the food was fresh and tasty. The wine, also worth it!
Warm, intimate with great service. The food wonderful, fresh, cooked and spiced perfectly. We had the burrata salad which was a joy with a silky pesto. Our main courses were mussels and swordfish done exactly right. The dessert was a creme brulee using black sesame seeds. A friend familiar with NYC restaurants recommended it and we will thank her with a couple of bottles of BeaujolaisEat and live! 
A great experience, super fresh food and excellent service, the place is very well decorated in the French style, I loved it, 100% recommended
Base in Manhattan since beg of the year, i dedicate that place as my second home. Kitchen always fresh and tasty. All staff amazing and respectful. Many thanks to them btw. 
Stopped by for an excellent lunch. The escargot was fresh and divinely garlicky, the onion soup was light and savory, and the smoked duck breast to die for. Highly recommend the charcuterie and cheese plate as well. The menu and the wine list are a touch limited at lunch, but the selections were excellent and the service was impeccable. 
Good experience, we enjoyed food and wine selection. The place itself was cozy and comfortable. We felt relaxed and fresh.
The food was pretty good especially the escargots and the carr√© d'agneau, but I had the Saint Jacques Provencal for main course. Well, the sea scallops were ordinary, but the promised provencal sauce turned out to be tomato paste fresh out of the can. Oh, the chocolate mousse was excellent, but the scallops with tomato paste were disappointing.Also, there was a middle age gentleman having dinner at the bar who seemed to be the manager, but all he was doing was enjoying his meal.
Service was outstanding. Every need was taken care of It was restaurant week and the specials were to die for. The sauces were superior and the fish was really fresh.
My husband and I enjoyed a wonderful breakfast here. The food was fresh, and very nicely presented. Fabulous service. I loved the quiet romantic ambiance of the restaurant and people watching out the large windows.
This place is INCREDIBLE!! The chef is creative, talented and humble. He has created the design of the dishes and gets fresh ingredients daily. The service was extremely personable, warm and friendly. A West Village and Greenwich Village must. Not stuffy French; extremely good food at prices that won‚Äôt blow the budget! 
We got the Chateaubriand and Rack of lamb for dinner. Absolutely delicious- great flavor and fresh ingredients. Chocolate mousse for dessert was also great!The portions are a little on the smaller side, but still satisfying. The place itself is quaint so you could feel disrupted as others couples get seated or get up to leave. The wait staff is excellent- patient and very attentive without being overbearing.Would definitely come back again!
Great dinner at Petite Boucherie. I would particularly recommend the scallops, they were excellent! Atmosphere in this small restaurant is very nice and makes a difference compared to a lot of noisy places in New York. Service was close to perfect with the necessary attention while not pushing for anything. I would definitely come back. 
We visited during the 3rd birthday celebration. The shop was beautifully decorated and festive. We went upstairs to the cafe so that we could order food not just treats. It is lovely with an open airy design. Service could be better, I noticed at least four tables being served water at the tmsame time as we were. We had to ask for water and it took at least 5 minute while the other tables had been seated before us. We ordered the Tokyo set which included fried chicken, salad, green tea latte and a matcha and passion fruit dessert. We also had a lobster roll and cronut (pineapple lemongrass). The chicken was well cooked and well seasoned in typically Japanese style it was chicken thighs, salad was fresh and lightly dressed but also only baby lettuces, the cronut was nice but I don‚Äôt get the obsession. Finally the matcha and passion fruit dessert was good, but the layer on top with ganach and white chocolate was too sweet, leave it off and it was perfect. All in all a good place to get a treat, but the cafe is over priced.
I was surprised that I was able to get a last minute reservation for a Saturday so close to the holidays. The reviews had been mostly good so I was wondering what was going on. It was our 22nd anniversary and I was just pleased to have scored a reservation. We were greeted warmly and seated immediately in this small, well lit and cozy restaurant. We ordered the burrata which was creamy and served with olives, sun dried tomatoes and crusty french bread. It was served differently than I'm used to but we thoroughly enjoyed it. We then shared the french onion soup which was delicious, and then shared the steak frittes and the nicoise salad. The steak was cooked perfectly and as requested (medium rare) and the salad was dressed well and very fresh and flavorful. We highly recommend Dominique Bistro and will be going back for sure.
We went with a friends for a dinner. We were in the city for a few days. The whole ambience , cocktails, food were outstanding . The lady who served us Paola she was fabulous. Thank you Boucherie Team thank you Paola !
I haven‚Äôt been here since the whole covid thing and I have to say this visit did not disappoint.The staff, Sophie and Jeremy are amazing and took really good care of me and the food remain as good as I remember! So Kudos to the team.
There is a special charm to this location and building which drew me in from the minute I walked by. I didn't make a reservation but was seated immediately by the front windows. The food was what I was expecting and the menu was thoughtful with some flares here and there. I thought my whole experience was charming and the service was on point. I would certainly go back and bring friends. Bravo!
I just want to thank the two gentlemen who turned our night around. Bilal and Micka you are godsend I'm sending all my contacts over. Go see for yourself
A great, authentic restaurant. The service team is very well-coordinated, friendly, present and very helpful. The food was great and very French-style. The selection of drinks was very balanced and the overall price-performance ratio was very good! Conclusion: Little France, in the middle of one of the most beautiful districts of New York. We will be back. Chapeau + Merci
This restaurant offers a high quality modern twist on some classic dishes. Its atmosphere makes it perfect for a romantic date or a low key meeting with friends (think of Mme Bardot in the wall and picturesque details- if you are one of those terrible people who spend their lifetimes posting pictures of food on Instagram you will be incredibly happy).The fact that it is based in an already charming place (the gay village) is another plus. Wine prices seem excessive for an European, but that seems very much the rule in Manhattan and in all fairness, the wine list seemed better balanced compared to other places.Food's spirit is more congruent with a brasserie than a bistro. Expect to pay approx 60 dollars per person at least, but still relatively good value taking into account you are in the village and I would definitely recommend it for a nice dining experience if you are in Manhattan.
This affordable French Boucherie is a Top 10 TripAdvisor gem. We got seats at the bar during ‚ÄúGreen Hour‚Äù with $10 drinks and low priced wine. Then ordered the lamb which was fantastic! Great service Fun vibe. Give it a go! 
My daughter and I had reservations for Sunday brunch. The restaurant was small so reservations were essential. We split the French onion soup and the Croque Monsieur accompanied by salad greens. The Croque Monsieur was one of the best I had ever eaten as was the French onion soup. What a charming restaurant!
Fantastic. Great food, organic, fresh, tasty.Quick, active personnel they take good care of you.Located in a spectacular area, it makes you feel outside the city. 
We had a lovely dinner at Jams Sat night while visiting our daughter at NYU. The scallops appetizer, monkfish, mussels, and cavatelli were so good! Restaurant has a relaxed, organic, urban garden feel to it. Our waitress Hannah was sweet, gave great recommendations of what was in season, and the right amount of attention to a family catching up. Would definitely come back!
.We stumbled into here as tourists wandering back from Central Park. How lucky we were to find this gem. I thought as a father and two young daughters in day wear we might not be allowed in as the place is cool and upmarket. I was wrong the staff were welcoming and kind. The place has a buzz about it the decor is mostly light wood and greenery with lots of touches. It feels both chic and comfortable.I had monkfish served in a lovely sauce and accompanied with decent pur√©es Organic cola drink was good as was a starter of hummus we all shared accompaniment of sweet fresh figs and good warm breadWe thoroughly enjoyed our meal
This restaurant is one of my favorites in New York, and one of the best in the Central Park area. I had high expectations when I first dined at Jams, because the chef, Jonathan Waxman, has a fair amount of hype around him. Well, the hype is absolutely earned, because the food is outstanding. My table ordered the focaccia and hummus pita for apps, and I had the winter gnocchi for my main. Both were amazing. The cocktails were also wonderful. I highly recommend the Sunburnt on SB -- but everyone in my group loved their order. The drink menu focuses on local and/or organic alcohol brands, with a few items on the menu donating to charity. Our group did not feel bad about ordering one too many, because it was for a good cause :) Service was friendly and attentive, and the 1 Hotel is also just a beautiful venue. My friends and I can't wait to go back. 
We loved our Christmas Brunch at Jams. To me, service can make or break a meal and this was definitely a service winner!! Our server Emda was amazing and helped us celebrate my wife‚Äôs birthday with a smile and impeccable service. The croissants were tasty and authentic, the French toast was rich and satisfying, and the Benedict was a true classic done to perfection. We loved the organic greenery and the lighthearted ambience made for a wonderful experience. So glad we chose to dine here!
Super cute restaurant with a great menu for brunch and breakfast. Organic juices and fresh food. Would recommend. 
This is our first time visiting NY after COVID-19, some of the old places are no longer there so we.found this little gem close to Central Park on 6th Ave.The brunch menu is diverse, organic and healthy, has a nice variety of different foods like the pretzel croissant or the plancha brunch and even a delicious avocado toast with greens. Definitely a comeback place
Good organic breakfast place close to the Central Park. Wide range of choice from super healthy to heavy hangover fighters.
Every time we go to NYC we end up having breakfast at Sarabeths on Park Avenue South, as we always walk Central Park for exercise. We have now discovered Jams Restaurant, which is attached to the 1Hotel property on 57th and 6th Avenue. What a treat. Great organic offerings, wonderful service and freshly sourced food. The oatmeal/quinoa with nuts and fruit is excellent, the fruit plate can be share by two or three and includes wonderful selections and the bacon and eggs with whole grain toast added the protein and tastes for my palate. Pricing is typical for NYC.
each time i dine here its a pleasure. all good, whether alone at the bar or a table date. food is fresh, smart with care and organics. staff is friendly and helpful. i know we all eat a lot of chicken, but must say Jams is exceptional 
Food was organic and creative with great flavor. The bar staff was professional, knowledgeable and very enjoyable to be around. Highly recommend Jams!!! 
I went here for the Sunday buffet brunch. The atmosphere is very relaxed and comfortable and the food is quite good. They have the standard brunch items with a slight lean towards trending organic foods.Overall, I thought the food was very good. My only reason for the 4 stars is that I think the price is slightly higher than the quality of the food. I still plan to return though.
Had breakfast at Jams last week. The menu was quite unique in choices such as Spiced French toast Skewers with maple syrup & pecans. Food was lovely, unique, and service was amazing. Staff very attentive and enjoyed the experience very much.
Great ambiance inside, and also outside sidewalk dining - as well as room service for the 1 HOTEL. Delicious healthy food locally sourced and well prepared. 
We stayed in the hotel adjacent to Jams, so ate breakfast 6 mornings in a row and also had a couple of dinners at Jams. The food was terrific, the people were friendly and attentive (but not over the top), and we had a great time at Jams, every time. Great atmosphere, and good food! We especially enjoyed the fresh, organic seasonal food and the grilled food.The staff took good care of us every visit! Thanks!
Beautiful restaurant with amazing decor, definitely has the feel of a 1 hotel restaurant, both with the quality of food and ingredients and with the nature aspect with the style and interior design of the place, giving the illusion of eating in nature surrounded by all the beautiful greenery.The food was delicious and fresh, and I could not recommend the gnocchi enough, definitely get it along with some great appetizers.Can‚Äôt forget to mention a special thanks to the lovely Egypt that made our experience even better than it already was.Definitely will be back for more.
My friends and I had an amazing experience at Jams! The food was exceptional and we loved it. The salads were incredibly fresh, and the risotto was flavorful without being too rich. The drinks crafted by Carlisle was a highlight! each drink was a burst of deliciousness. The watermelon margarita was just like natural juice. A special shoutout to Danny, who made the evening even more enjoyable. Can't wait to go back for another delightful dining experience!
Firs time visit to Jams 1 hotel and my first time with my Family and my first Review, it Was very busy Breakfast We didn‚Äôt make Reservation but we get table ready in 5 minutes around ,Started with Cappuccinos and Delightful assortment Party‚Äôs Our server Rowan Recommend Jams omelet Avocado,Tofu Scramble green drink ext ext...wow delicious, best BFmenu that offered an extensive choice of Breakfast, and stand out was the service and thanks to Rowan who made our Morning Breakfast remarkable,He was professional, attentive, I Dine in so many places so far Jams is the Best everybody love it,Beautiful Restaurant Classic Natural looks from inside ,we visit Ever year 2 times in NYC but never noticed about this Outstanding 1 Hotel Restaurant we mostly stay at Plaza Hotel, But we find our place in NYC ,Next Visit Surely 1Hotel Jams.
We dropped in for a drink and light dinner. Jams is within the 1 Hotel - Central Park which reflects a natural look with plants and natural materials. Quite nice effect. OMG the bar-lounge was very busy with the after-work smart set! Almost every seat was taken but we found a spot at the bar by the corner and enjoyed a good reasonably priced bottle of red. And late a good reprosadoThe food was a hit and miss. Sorry. The oysters were not ocean fresh. One was over the hill. Ugh and it was the last one I ate leaving an unpleasant aftertaste . The clam appetizer which was sort of a very rich and thick clam chowder with toasts was wonderful. The tuna poke would have embarrassed anyone who has tasted the many and wildly varied pokes in Hawaii. A good poke is not terribly difficult to make, even in its exotic interpretations, but this one was definitely uninspired, over salted and in search of a culinary direction. Skip it.Service at the bar was slow but friendly. They were extremely busy, so it was understandable.Again the place is happening with good people watching, so its an OK place but order pretty standard items and have a good time.
Everyone at the restaurant is expertly trained and seemingly naturally helpful and friendly. The food was creative, delicious and hearty. The selections were bountiful, appetizing and tasty. The children were made to feel special as the attention was specific, natural and kid friendly. Terrific restaurant.
We had a lovely last meal at this restaurant and truly enjoyed the night. A perfect end to a New York holiday. ! The food and service were impeccable and well worth the visit. The food was divine and its a great place for a drink as well as it has a lively bar. I really like the Scandinavian feel of the restaurant with its earthy and natural elements. I also highly recommend the breakfasts there. Portions are on the large size - the Jams chicken could have fed 2 people. The pasta was perfectly cooked. All in all a lovely meal.
Decoration is just perfect to take you out of the city into the woods. The relaxed ambience will make easy to enjoy your delicious food and comfortably chat with friends.A must while in NYC
Quite simply, my favorite restaurant in the area (I'm a local who lives about 50 yards from this place). This is our go to (my wife, 5 year old son and I).Here's why:1. Ingredients/Food - These guys very carefully source all their ingredients (farm to fork) minimizing the need to ask, "is this pesticide free?" or "is this antibiotic free?" Fantastic!2. Staff - I can't speak highly enough of Katherine (she's a terrific asset) and her crew. Last time out, Rabuj looked after us and service was once again superb. 3. Ambience - When you spend time thinking about your impact on your environment, decent people show up and follow. Here's a small example: you can plant the restaurants card in water and soil and watch it grow.My one gripe is that they don't more prominently promote the care and attention they go through to source and select good ingredients. This is a huge asset, but you really have to ask to learn more.
Such a great spot! Round of applause overall, from the amazing service of Saydimar and manager Daniel who were able to accommodate us without reservations. Food is delicious, our favorites were the scallops from Maine, the summer truffle Orzo risotto, and the Bison Tomahawk with herbed butter. Watermelon Margaritas are a must. Ambiance is on point. Conveniently located steps away from Central Park. checked all of the boxes for us!
I have fond memories of Jams in Albemarle Street in London in the 80s. It was our first exposure to "California cuisine " The restaurant was bright and airy and always jammed. It was only because the principle backer was a friend of ours that we could get a table. The food was a revelation at the time. Salads like we had never seen them before with fresh herbs a several varieties of lettuces and other greens in each. They were large and lavish and FRESH!!!!I was delighted to discover that JAMS had returned to New York and close to where i stay at 58th Street and 6th Ave.However this restaurant bears no resemblance to the former one. We both had salad. One with shrimp and one with chicken. They were meant to have Green Goddess dressing but the dressing was insipid. The lettuce was iceberg as described but poorly selected and both the shrimp and chicken were poorly cooked . The shrimp were small and unseasoned. Frankly similar could be found anywhere and certainly far cheaper. Our bill was 77$ with one Campari soda and a portion of fries. Around the corner in Bergdorf Goodman the restaurant on the 5th floor serves far better in much fancier surroundings for roughly the same price with beautiful flatware and glasses.I dont know why or how Jonathan Waxman can put his name to this but maybe he has selective amnesia and has forgotten how to put food together. We were so disappointed that we didn't bother to have a dessert or coffee. I can't possibly recommend this restaurant. Two stars is too generous.
We were staying in this hotel so had breakfast twice. Both times I had the egg white omelette which was filled with herbs and spring onions. Was delicious and light and felt so healthy! Menu is geared up for healthy eating I would say.Staff were friendly apart from two of the male staff who were on the front desk as you walk in the restaurant entrance - one looked blankly at us as we walked in (think they thought we had just stumbled in off the street even though we were hotel residents) and the other one (said he had just started) was a little offish with us when we asked to sit outside, he told us we couldnt at the weekends and then went to sit us on a table in the middle to which we said could we sit at one around the side (one that was designed for two people anyway so dont see the problem) - he looked a little put out!!Apart from that cannot fault it.
Very good food and the service was perfect (Thank you Rowan!) Location very romantic and eco-friendly. The good energy to start the day in NYC!!!
Passed this restaurant in the morning and though it had a nice look about it and went back for the lunch. Everything seemed very "green" and environmentally friendly. The staff were polite and friendly, the drinks and food were served quickly. The food was good, the only problem was no one came back to see if we wanted a dessert or second drink. It was a good experience but not good enough to rush back.
I had an amazing time at Jams, their sustainable focus was a big draw for me and they over delivered! They had a special sustainable menu with wine pairings that blew us away, and anyone who eats there has to get the gnocchi (one of the best dishes in the city). Super friendly and helpful staff made it a wonderful evening.
It was so good! Great vibe, solid cocktails, and a sustainable menu. The live DJ was a fun experience too! 
The food and ambiance is great. It‚Äôs in a very nice hotel with a sustainable theme. The omelette and yogurt with granola we shared was great. My only minor complaint was that the coffee was just very so so. I like strong big coffees and this just was blah. 
What a wonderful surprise! i was looking on tripadvisor for a place to have brunch and was attracted to Jams by the looks of it. However, the real beauty of this place is inside ... Roberto one of the wonderful waiters explained to me that this restaurant and the hotel next to it are paperless and extremely oriented to a sustainable existence. The furniture has been recycled, the leftovers are turned into compost, the cartons recycled.... and their biodegradable business cards contain flower seeds on it that you can plant on a pot !!! What else can you ask for ?! Loved it !!! 
Great food, great service, incredible location. I definitely recommend this place for breakfast or lunch.
nice atmosphere to spend time and have a tasty meal . very pleasant atmosphere. Great space. Clean, tasty, good service. liked it very much
We were starving after traveling and had some bad luck with a few restaurants before stumbling upon Jams, very close to our hotel. The hostess sat us immediately with a friendly smile! Our server, Mamun, was very attentive and went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and special! Even though he had a lot of tables to attend to, he checked on us often and made sure we had what we needed. He was very personable and relatable too. We thoroughly enjoyed his friendly, attentive service! The food quality was excellent with a beautiful presentation (and my family members are healthy eaters and picky about food quality so this says a lot). They have many healthy but tasty options. The chicken was particularly wonderful. The atmosphere is beautiful too! Very clean restaurant. We would definitely go back when visiting NYC and would definitely ask for Mamun as a server if he was working. Give this place a chance! It does not disappoint!
Nice restaurant close to Central Park South. Food was solid and straightforward. Presentation clean and simple and enticing for the eye. What you see is what you are eating - good food speaks for itself, no need for fluff and zhuzhing. Service at the table was good. Ambiance is pleasant and restaurant was not overly loud in spite it was almost full. Prices are very reasonable - definitely a good value for your money and very pleasant dining experience. We decided to enjoy each other‚Äôs company and good food and wine instead of picture taking. I would recommend that too.
Dinning in upper Manhattan, can at times be challenging, good food at reasonable prices is hard to find. Jams is worth a visit. A modern clean restaurant with a roomy atmospher, incorporating the standard bar environment.Menu is varied and portion sizes good without being over faced.. As always in the location quality does not come cheap, but this is a good option..
Went to Jams with my wife for the rare date night, which involves driving into town from Queens, securing parking, and finding a sitter for our 2 year old. Totally worth it! We had been there before last summer for a quick drink before going to a show and had promised ourselves to one day return for the full dining experience - great decision. Amazing service by both Carlos and Bruce - they somehow were there at every turn providing really helpful insight, truly friendly service, and just the right amount of attention to detail without giving off the hovering sensation you sometimes feel from your server. The vibe was perfect too - elegant, clean, modern, but not stuffy. The food was incredible...every...single...dish. My favorite was the house made gnocchi paired with wild mushrooms. Their menu changes daily according to what is local and seasonal, which is what we look for and very hard to find, especially at these very reasonable prices. If you are looking for a place that takes great care in quality of ingredients combined to maximize flavor in a fine dine setting without the budget busting prices then this is definitely your place. Can't wait to go back and try the brunch menu!
Breakfast at Jams on Jan 22, 2018, was another 5 star experience. From the greeting by the hostess to the incredibly attentive and gracious, Kathy, our table server, we will continue to return to this restaurant for its clean, "green" ambiance, its menu and delicious dishes, and its warm and welcoming staff. Who knew it could get even better? But after a visit to the restroom, well, it did.
We have been here about five times now, mostly for brunch. They have the BEST unique cocktails made with high quality ingredients. Today I ordered a St. Germain cocktail, a croissant, and an omelette with Cabot white cheddar cheese, scallions, and greens along with a side of fresh cut fries. Everything is always delicious here and the atmosphere is clean, trendy, and artfully decorated. Our bartender was also very friendly. Can't wait to return!üòãüç∏ü•ê
We had a very good meal made even better by level of service. The little things make a difference, clean flatware for each course and a full water glass. Pleasant wait and bus staff is just a cherry on top. 
Jams is at the ground floor of 1 central hotel it occupies a good location overlooking 6th Avenue. The ambience is great. Clean surroundings. Good service. Variety of food. I enjoyed the pasta and deserts most. 
Jams was recommended to us by some friends that had recently visited. It was wonderful! The restaurant is super clean and very cool. Our waiter, Sabuj , was excellent! I would ask to sit I his area. He suggested the pancakes with smoked salmon...AMAZING!! I was leery of "pancakes" but wanted to try since it was a specialty. Super delish! Friends had the risotto and chicken and very impressed. Glad I followed this recommendation! 
This upscale restaurant is low key and offers many healthy options for a variety of guests (omnivores, carnivores, herbivores). Surrounded by greenery, this restaurant appears inviting upon walking inside the front glass doors. The bathroom was clean, and the hostess and bartender were helpful in supplying me a card for the restaurant review. The review card itself even came on a special paper you can plant. Sharing a message with the world to go green can't be any easier than that.
Excellent breakfast and great service. The atmosphere is so relaxing and the restaurant is extremely clean. 
Nice environment to have a salad or meal. Nice clean hip place and reasonably priced. Friendly staff and give service.
A great find in our hotel of all places! We decided to grab dinner in the hotel on our way to Lincoln Center to save time after a busy busy day. it was a great decision. Our food was interesting, clean, very well presented and the staff was outstanding. Breakfast was also remarkable.
We live in the neighborhood and had strolled by a few times. We came in on a quiet evening. The ambiance with all the plants is gorgeous and relaxing. Our server Kiri was a delight, and her dessert recommendation was delicious!A charming local find.
super nice staff and good quality food, locally sourced. nicely served. good table spacing. a pleasant crowd.
We popped into Jam‚Äôs to have a quick bite to eat before the local stores opened at 10am. It was snowing and very cold so it was with relief to enter the restaurant. We were shown to a table but asked if we could take a corner seat as it wasn‚Äôt very busy and we didn‚Äôt want to sit right up next to someone else. The hostess was not very happy with our request and make it very obvious it was inconvenient but allowed us to change. We had wet coats, hats etc but were not asked if we would like them hung up so had to drape them over the seats. We had bagels & cereal which were nicely presented. Nice restaurant but would help if the staff were friendlier especially the hostess. 
Everything was fresh, local and delicious! I recommend the kale salad. The bok choy was yummy as well at the roasted potatoes. My daughter had the gnocchi and loved it. I also recommend the Stormy Weather cocktail! We shall return...
My wife and I stumbled onto Jams expecting to stop for a drink on our way back from Central Park. We sat on the streetside patio on a warm Oct evening and after hearing the description of the food, opted to stay. It was amazing! All prepared with local fresh food- was tasty yet not ‚Äúfroofy‚Äù. My wife and I appreciate good, well prepared food that looks nice, but avoid the over-the-top foodie places that over emphasize look and leave you hungry. This was the perfect intersection of quality, quantity and place - with excellent servers to top it off. Highly recommended. PS you have to try the kale salad - I‚Äôve only tolerated kale until I tried this updated version of a caesar salad. 
I met a couple of friends for lunch at Jams. Bright lit restaurant, beautifully decorated in muted colors. You have your choice of high tables and low tables. The menu is well balanced, fresh and local. The sandwiches looked so good, unfortunately they did not have Gluten free bread so I settled for a delicious salad. My friends loved their sandwiches. Service was wonderful and not rushed at all. We lingered for about three hours and they did not kick us out. Will go there again.
The super fresh locally sourced produce at Jam's is amazing. Catherine, the Manager is a sheer delight and her gorgeous smile greeted me daily as l was a guest at the 1 Hotel Central Park which Jam's is a part of. The delightfully healthy green juice is a fantastic way to start you day. On days that you throw the diet rightfully out the window as you are on vacation, you can't go past the french toast....it is simply decadent and delicious. One night l had the scallops for dinner and they so good that l called the chef over and personally thanked them for the experience. They were the best scallops l have ever eaten anywhere in the world.
We had a quick late night dinner last week. Food was delicious, especially the seafood linguine. Our server was superb.Great, unpretentious food in a casual, eco inspired dining room. 
The menu was great, with locally sourced products. Perfect seasonal comfort food. The staff was beyond friendly and very attentive. I had the duck breast with polenta. The duck was perfectly cooked and the skin was crisp. The texture of the polenta was just right. The bartender paired the perfect wine with the meal which complemented the whole experience. 
There are many other more local and quirky spots to eat in NYC but not too many in this area and midtown also has less options unless going high end so this works.We stayed close by and after a manic day on the go didn't want to venture back downtown or too far so ate here. It was really nice and reasonably priced for NYC. Nice friendly staff and nice decor and served us very well.If you are staying close by and don't want to go too far then this is a good spot for sure. 3 stars may be a little harsh as as an individual experience it was closer to 4 but relative to other places in NYC which I have to rate against 3 is fair in that respect. But I would recommend it under the right circumstances if that makes sense!
Late night after the theater, my wife and I blindly chose to visit Jams at 1 Hotel (Central Park). We felt the vibe as soon as we sat at the bar. We were treated to fast, friendly and attentive setvice right from the start. Frank and his entire bar staff were great. In the spirit of fun, we were asked to "taste test" some of the bar's future mixology concoctions. Although recipes are "top secret" and still in development, I can tell you that some locally harvested maple syrup and honey are both in "the mix". Frank's passion for fun refreshment is quite evident! We also shared wonderful conversation with 'Kat', a regular patron and special friend of Frank and the entire Jams staff. Thanks for a great late night treat!
Tasty breakfast with plenty healthy stuff, good coffee and fresh ginger tea. Friendly staff and fantastic interior design of the restaurant. 
Great ambiance, music, cool and relaxed vibe. fresh and healthy selections - huevos rancheros was very flavorful. Nicole, our server, was personable, attentive. Burger was charred just right - cooked perfectly to order. Fries were done perfectly. 
We had a wonderful experience at Jams and would highly recommend it to all! Fresh and delicious food, beautiful presentation, attentive and friendly wait staff made it a great night out. Thank you to our server, Saydimar, and her assistant, Monsur, for their menu suggestions. Our meal was wonderful! We opted for several small plates to start and would recommend the smooth and creamy fresh burrata, ample hummus plate with soft pita, fresh seared tuna, the beet and watermelon salad with crunchy toasted pistachios and the summer salad with peaches and feta. Both salads were a perfect combination of crisp vegetables, ripe juicy fruit, and light but tangy dressing...delicious! The JW chicken was as delicious as it was beautifully plated, the strip steak was extremely flavorful and the generous portion allowed all of us to enjoy it. Vegetarians will not be disappointed as both the risotto and summer gnocchi were very tasty. We recommend leaving room for dessert. My son loved the cookie plate while others enjoyed the tiramisu which is presented tableside. Our server playfully poured a shot of espresso through a chocolate funnel leaving it for us to crush the funnel and enjoyed it atop the creamy deliciousness of the tiramisu with slightly crunchy little cookie pieces‚Ä¶.yum! We definitely plan to dine at Jams again soon!
Love the food and all the ingredients are very freshThe highlight was the server Emda who was extremely friendly, kind and efficient.I felt at home !
We stopped in on a whim and were blown away. The marinated olives were the best we‚Äôve had in a long time, and the beet salad, guacamole and wilted greens, delicious. Fresh squeezed green juice was just the reset we needed and was so tasty! Contrary to this review, they have way more on the menu than veggies!!, it‚Äôs just what we happened to be in the mood for. Our server Mamun was fantastic and the entire vibe of the restaurant was upscale, and trendy boho chic. Will definitely return next time we‚Äôre in Manhattan!
Ate lunch here after skating at Central Park. Food was very fresh and creative and generous portions. Our server Emda was wonderful as well!
Great Brunch Spot!! And Breakfast! Eggs Benedict was amazing! Great coffee as well and everyone loved the food so highly recommend for breakfast/brunch! Lots of healthy options, great fresh fruit and frittatas-juices- brioche frenxh toast- something for everyone!
Gorgeous spot that is scattered with greenery, an indoor take a Central Park. Daniel was welcoming and got me and my group seated at a great table. Service was top notch, our servers Saydimar and Rumon were knowledgeable and made the best recommendations. Jams old fashioned and Frozen watermelon margs were delicious. Steak was juicy and tender. The tiramisu was the highlight, they pour fresh espresso over a chocolate dome, each bite was better than the last. 
Founds Jams online looking for a place to meet for brunch. It‚Äôs a great location right by Central Park. The restaurant is part of a hotel. Has cool decor and vibe. Service staff was nothing out of the ordinary. Prices are crazy even by NY standards. $10 for a TINY dish of (somewhat)fresh fruit!
Great fish tacos. Excellent service. The front of house manager who seated gave us the best table in the house and our server, Rowan, was warm, friendly, and knowledgeable
Rowan was our server and did an excellent job! He was very attentive and kind, refilling coffees and was always paying attention if we needed something. The food exceeded expectations--fresh fruit and great eggs. Very close to Central Park. The space is beautiful and green as well. We'll be back!
Food was incredible service was great definitely recommend! Was great value and the whole atmosphere was nice and inviting
Jams is by far one of my most memorable dining experiences I have ever had in New York City! Kaila greeted us at the door and made us feel so welcomed. Our server Jacqueline was the best she was so on top of everything, she recommended the perfect dishes as well as drink pairings and made our first experience one of the best we have ever had at any restaurant! Monsur was the kindest as he made sure to tell us all about every dish that was dropped at the table in detail! Jamalur was incredible helping out at our table making sure we were taken care of and comfortable throughout our whole meal. Danny the manager is the absolute best, so kind and attentive. He really made our dining experience here seem so personable and special. I can‚Äôt forget to mention the drinks were fantastic!!! Daniel the bartender is a wizard the drinks were to die for!! Last but not least Chef!!! Chef Carina‚Ä¶.we cannot applaud you enough! The food was to die for! We started with a cheese board followed by the scallops and truffle croquettes (you must get!) for entrees we had the cavetelli and monkfish, which were delightful! So much flavor in all of their dishes I am beyond impressed by the chef and all The staff. Jams is a must visit on your list! 10/10 reccomended for food and service It is an all around incredible NYC gem! 
I stayed at the One Hotel in NYC by Central Park, and Jams is attached. We all know what attached restaurants are typically like: court appointed lawyers at best. But Jams is amazing. Breakfast? Get the Katsu sandwich. It‚Äôs my new favorite sandwich in the whole world bar none. Lunch? Well, I had something light, but we had meetings here that Jams catered, and so we ate three or four meals of amazing dishes, like their gnocchi, the chicken, their falafal wrap is insane. I loved their gazpacho, too (yellow tomato soup, with cucumbers and melons). Their spicy nuts are better if you pair them with something. I didn‚Äôt have dinner here, though. I can‚Äôt tell you. My guess after all the other food? Amazing. But please don‚Äôt take my word for that. I might be lying, because I didn‚Äôt have dinner. Of note: Rowan the server captain? He was amazing. I came down after checking out of my room and told him I needed to set up and work for a few hours at a table. (No server wants to hear this.) Rowan was VERY accommodating. He kept my iced coffee (with oat milk) filled. He checked in just enough that I didn‚Äôt feel abandoned, but not so much that I thought I had to pay him to be an assistant. I know that the other servers are also very high quality. I can only name two others: Terrell, Kiri. Both were also excellent. The others were great. I just didn‚Äôt get their names, and they didn‚Äôt serve me AS much (look - how many restaurant staff can you hold up?) You don‚Äôt have to be a hotel guest to stop here and eat. Do yourself a favor and get that breakfast sandwich. You‚Äôll email me about it.
This spot is located inside the 1 Hotel Central Park. It had a nice amount of seating, although not huge space. We started off with some drinks. I chose Grapes of Wrath. The interesting thing was that they had some sugar on the outside rims, but only about half of less than half the glass rim was coated‚Ä¶ Did they forget to do the other side, or they realized after half way that they were not supposed to do that??? My hubby went with Apple Crusta. It was more lemony than apple, which was a bit confusing‚Ä¶ We ordered Maplebrook Burrata and Salt Cod Brandade to share as appetizers, and they were both really great! We all enjoyed it a whole lot. For main, I had Coconut-Curry Seafood Stew. It was delicious, spicy and full of jewels of the sea! The others went with Berkshire Pork Chop, and Pan Roasted Atlantic Hake. I heard it was the best pork chop she ever had, and the hake was a big hit too. We also had one side dish to share: Fried Fingerling Potatoes. Sooo good, it disappeared quickly! Since we all enjoyed the food massively, we decided to push our luck with desserts. We had Cranberry-Almond Tart, Ginger Sticky Toffee Pudding, and Chocolate-Peanut Butter Baked Alaska. They were all really good, but the tart was the crowd's favorite. The bathrooms were not in a great shape. I heard one of them were not tidy (toilet paper all over on the floor), and another one, the toilet was not flushing. I went into the one with the broken toilet, and since I am a proud handy-woman, I fixed it for them before I used it. Seems like several people had used the toilet before I came along, so I wonder when any of their staffs went to check the cleanliness of the bathroom‚Ä¶ The rest of the space and the food was amazing, so it is very disappointing to see that they are not putting enough care to their bathroom‚Ä¶ Other than that, the service was great. Our water glass was always filled, and we were well taken care of. I would love to go back and try more of their amazing dishes!
We were looking for a quick lunch spot near our hotel. The exterior caught our attention, so we stopped in. The space was welcoming, well designed and comfortable. It has a cozy bar and several types of seating in the restaurant. The menu offered a good variety. I ordered the Tofu Scramble with was delicious‚Äîeven the whole-grain toast that came with it was tasty. My partner got the burger which came with a bunch of fries. The prices were reasonable, the food was delicious. I would go back anytime.
Walking down the street when it started raining and we noticed that this was a Jonathan Waxman restaurant. We found everything about this place to please us.This was the whole experience. The service was great. While we drink wine every day we asked our server for a recommendation and he asked us if we were adventurous eaters and drinkers. He then suggested an interesting wine from grapes grown in volcanic soil. It paired perfectly with the food. Dishes were inventive but not molecular, filled with flavor and reasonably portioned. It would be hard not to mention the decor. Walk around and go upstairs. Inventive and creative without shouting " This costs a lot and you can't afford it." Simple touches say a lot.We would go back again.
Let me commence by saying I have lived all over the world including NYC for 6 years. So by default eating out is a luxury and a NYC way of life. I was looking for a decent breakfast place to treat my lovely lady and we happened upon Jams Restaurant-hands down best random act ive performed since breaking out in song in my office after italy won the 2006 world cup!From the moment I walked in the Manager Jeff was simply awesome. He found us a table with a gorgeous view and intermittently checked in on us, without ever being overbearing. He was simply delightful and his warm and inviting demeanor was refreshing for a bustling Saturday morning in nyc. Bring on the food (and the Sabuj-ill get to him!) I had the mushroom scramble which was drizzled with goats cheese. It was photo worthy if not for the fact I swallowed it whole! The lovely got the egg white omelet and traded out the feta for goat cheese and it was off the charts. Id definitely recommend the cheese switch up.we later sampled the cobbler with ice cream and a creme brule' style dessert which was unsurprisingly mouth watering magic in a bowl!Food goes a large way to determining a dining experience but service is the other key ingredient! Enter our server Sabuj! I can only think Jeff arranged his top gun server to look after our experience. Not only was he a most personable, happy and charming young chap but his food recommendations and explanations were all on point. And everything. .....EVERYTHING was done with a smile and air of ease. Most of all he went completely out of his way to ensure my lovely girlfriend was at all times happy with her food and overall experience. That is a dying art form these days.So impressed were we by the seasonly fresh food that Sabuj actually invited Chef Rob out to chat with us about his creations. He was most happy to answer any questions and chat with us.we left Jams honestly feeling like rock stars. .....who cannot sing but were certainly satisfied with our food medley!
We had a business dinner at Jams and had a very enjoyable evening.Jams is just a block south of Central Park. The restaurant has lots of glass and brickwork so it fits in and seems to enjoy its own setting. The decor reflects the farm-to-table vibe in the menu and overall. I thought the service was a little distant, but that may just be me. It was certainly attentive and highly competent.The food was wonderful. I enjoyed in particular the restaurant's signature chicken. There were some things I did not like as much (a kale dish, for example), but that's mostly because I remain to be convinced that kale is actually food.A nice place in a nice location.
Excellent food , wonderful service!!! What a find. Highly recommend this farm to table restaurant!!!
We hit the town directly from the airport and had a wonderful dinner at Chef Jonathan Waxman‚Äôs famed Jams. The food is fresh, farm to table, with creative recipes and delicious execution! Sabuj was attentive, as our server, and made sure we had everything we needed, always, with helpers MD and Monsiuer. Scott selected the perfect wine, so we are glad we put that in his hands. Our dining party shared everything that was brought to the table, and I recommend that because the wild and seasonal assortments of flavors are amazing. Some of our favorites were the beets and beans salad, the radish salad, and‚Äîmy Norse favorite‚Äîthe savory lefse dish. Each of these were light, and fresh and so yummy! Our favorite pasta was the tagliatelle. The two main courses that we shared were the strip steak and the hake. Both were scrumptious, but if you get a chance to try that hake before the menu changes, do it! There are so many to thank for making our celebration special: Ginger Pierce and Chef Peter, Managers Tracy and Cris, and Chef Maddi! Did I mention dessert? I will write a separate review for that, deservedly so.
Since we were staying at the hotel we decided to eat breakfast at Jams. We were not disappointed. The farm to table restaurant had good options for my wife who is vegan and my self a pescatarian. There were also plenty of options for those preferring meat. The eggs I ordered was delicious as well as my wife tofu scramble. The toast and preserves were fresh and delicious.
Awesome kale salad for lunch. Had to force ourselves to leave the property, as we were staying in the 1Hotel attached. Between the restaurant and the hotel, almost didn't get to experience the rest of the city. Both superb! 
Excellent service and d√©cor , best example of good food on farm to table. Excellent wine list and attention .
Vibrant atmosphere with good farm to table fare. Worth a visit for a moderately priced meal and drinks.
I was told it'll be great and I guess my expectations were higher. While lunch was good not great, decor was better. Space has an industrial, farm-to-table vibe going on which makes it cozy, casual but fun. I liked how they did the space a lot. Service excellent. Not sure I'd go back. But in either case it's a good spot for lunch if in the area. Menu was almost basic and not innovative enough...the only redemption was the artichoke risotto, yummy, but lukewarm. 
My family and i spend New Years Eve at Jams we could have not picked a better place. service was speedy, staff cordial and waiter was very knowledgable of the menu. Relax atmosphere. Spare rib dish with a side order of sweet potato was killer delicious
Went here after seeing Sting at Carnegie Hall‚Ä¶ This was a great spot with delicious farm to table style menu. The food was spot on. Our server Kasey, was great! She was very knowledgable and super friendly, which made the experience even better! I would definitely recommend stopping by Jams if you're in midtown.
As a solo diner, I love to eat at nice restaurants where you can eat at the bar. I happened to pass by Jams and saw that there was a spot open on the corner of the bar that was calling my name! I did not want a big meal as I had been picking throughout the day in New York City on this and that. The Bartender who was extremely familiar with the menu and extremely nice and personable (I forgot to write down his name as I was pretty exhausted by the end of the meal!!) recommended that I have the Duck Confit Tacos that were on the app menu. Sine it was only two tacos, I accompanied with a fresh off the cob creamy corn dish as well as a shaved vegetable salad with an Apple Cider Vinegar. I started out with a nice Grey Goose lemon Drop cocktail that the bartender tasted at least three times until it was perfection!! The meal also delivered. The Duck Confit Tacos were amazing - Every ingredient was delicious and came through in the dish. The corn and veggie salad were just as amazing - These dishes were prepared so amazingly with ingredients that seemed like they were farm to table that morning! Best light meal I have ever had! The taste of the food and the service of the bartender made this a great NY experience. 
Delicious fresh farm to table meal for dinner, and equally wonderful brunch. Attentive and friendly staff. Wonderful atmosphere. 
Jams is one of my favorite restaurants in the city, whether it be for brunch or dinner! Service is always top notch and servers are very knowledgeable. You MUST try the gnocchi, the warm gem salad, and the cauliflower. Drinks are delicious and they have a great wine selection. The hosts always get me accommodated even when I don‚Äôt have a reservation, They have a DJ on weekends that spin vinyl records, great date night spot!
This restaurant is near Carnegie Hall and the Time Warner Center (Jazz at Lincoln Center), and not far from Lincoln Center, itself, making it a great pre-theater spot. We were a group of 4 who ordered a few starters and each of us also ordered a main dish - in all, probably 7 dishes. Every single one was fantastic, and I would order any one of them again. A simple thing like a kale Caesar salad was exceptional, as was the poke bowl. Both were flavorful without being overwhelming. The chicken dish (main) was notable, and the flavors in the duck breast were interesting and balanced. The mushroom gnocchi were more tasty than most, and if you like a big, rich dish, this one‚Äôs for you. Finally, the paccheri (wide pasta noodles) with pork rag√∫ will be tops on my list the next time we go. And we will be back!
Just had brunch at Jams yesterday, and it was everything I hoped it would be! We had the deviled eggs, the Benedict with ham, and the soft scrambled eggs with burrata and mushrooms, as well as a side of sourdough toast. Everything was well balanced flavor-wise, cooked to perfection, and absolutely delicious. The deviled eggs were the best we had ever had. Service was quick for a busy restaurant, and we never felt hurried by staff. Great atmosphere in restaurant too. I would absolutely return the next time I‚Äôm in NYC.
Just dropped in to look around and decided to have a late lunch in Jams. The chef is well known ( J Waxman). The menu is so nicely balanced with a range of items that appeal to everyone. A great kale salad. The chicken is roasted and has a crispy skin with a tarragon jus. I had the meatballs with creamy polenta and broccoli. All delicious.We will definitely return...maybe even later this week!
What an amazing night out with friends thanks to Jams. From Danny, the manager to Carlyle the bartender, to Ian the Chef, we we treated like royalty and the food/drinks were out of this world. Shout out to the Bison Tomahawk steak made by chef Ian! Yum! The living-green ambiance is stunning as well. I‚Äôll be sure to recommend this restaurant to everyone! 
Dining at Jams restaurant in 1 Hotel Central Park was an exceptional experience, deserving of nothing less than five stars. From the moment we stepped in, the atmosphere was captivating, adorned with an earthy, green decor and an abundance of vibrant flowers, creating a soothing and inviting ambiance.The culinary journey began with their exquisite burrata, a creamy delight that set the tone for the rest of the meal. However, the real star of the evening was the Wagyu burger, arguably the best burger in New York. Each bite was a perfect blend of flavors and textures, a testament to the chef's mastery.The bartenders at Jams deserve a special mention for their attentiveness and skill. They crafted amazing drinks that perfectly complemented the meal. Espresso Martini and Elm House Manhattan were flawless. For those preferring non-alcoholic options, the healthy mocktail choices were refreshing and creatively presented.Overall, Jams is more than just a dining spot; it's a culinary destination where every detail is thoughtfully curated to ensure an unforgettable experience. Whether it's the food, the drinks, or the ambiance, Jams sets a high standard for down to earth dining in New York.
This place is a part of the 1 hotel. I ve been staying in a hotel nearby but I would come for breakfast here every single morning of my stay.The food is exceptional, my favourite would be Green Shakshuka. The attention and care too, absolutely spectacular. Especially I d like to thank server Rowan. I felt like at a friends home. Thanks guys! By far my favourite breakfast place in the South of Park part of Manhattan
Just went to Jams for a Team Breakfast! Loved the green shakshuka. Ask them for the homemade hot sauce on the side! Chia pudding was amazing too!
Great drinks, great food (lamb chops were outstanding) great staff and cool atmosphere as the numerous plants and greens make this huge space also feel cozy. Went there for NYE party after a stroll in Central Park so also great for a date!
Emda was awesome. We love the green juice!! Food was great and there was no wait to be seated. Would recommend 
Jams Restaurant, located in the !Hotel Central Park, is a rare example of a"hotel restaurant"that can stand on its own as a fantastic destination dining experience! We have dined here many times, and every dish was always deliciously prepared true gourmet fare. On our most recent visit, we dined at one of the lovely outdoor tables, and had the pleasure of being served by Saydimar, who was charming, sweet, and very professional, and additionally attended to by Jackie, another caring, warm, and attentive member of the wonderful Jams staff. Although everything we've ever had from the menu is fantastic, the Jams Chicken is one of our two favorite "must always have" dishes -- it is definitely the BEST roast chicken in all of NYC, possibly the whole country! The Kale Caesar salad is another "must have" -- and we normally don't even like kale! The most delicious Caesar dressing on the planet -- it is sublime! The fries accompanying the chicken were perfectly crispy and flavorful, and the wilted greens and roasted baby carrots with romescue (which we had on a previous visit) were delicious as well. We were celebrating a birthday and were treated to a luscious chocolate caramel brownie ice cream dessert -- so decadently scrumptious that no words can do it justice! Saydimar and Jackie brought it over with a lit candle and a glass of liqueur, to make a special night even more special. We highly recommend booking a table at Jams for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, for an incredible dining experience!
We come here often for breakfast. They are, at times understaffed, but food is always great for breakfast. Nice "green" atmosphere.
The food here was absolutely fantastic, like five star gourmet quality. I‚Äôm vegan and sober, and they were able to accommodate me amazingly. All of the vegan dishes were some of the best I‚Äôve ever had - very savory and decadent tasting but very nutritious and vegetable forward at the same time. My favorites were the grilled baby gems with green goddess dressing, the tomato confit hummus and the beet salad. They also made me a delicious passionfruit mocktail that‚Äôs one of the best I‚Äôve ever had. The ambience is also beautiful, with hundreds of plants surrounding you, somewhat dim lighting, and nice music that‚Äôs not too loud.
We happened upon Jams on a delightful summer Sunday morning and it captured our imagination at first sight--the building is covered in all kinds of living greens and plants--lovely! We sat outside, enjoyed great drinks, delicious food (all impeccably plated) with good service. Just blissful! We will be back!
It‚Äôs a very well designed place. Pretty and comfortable inside. The food was a disappointment. My sister had the French toast which the waitress said was the best French toast she has ever had. Yea not so much. It was one thick piece of brioche bread with a huge pile of Creme fraiche and a strawberry compote that was bitter. My sister said it tasted sour and scraped everything off the bread. She wanted some syrup for the toast but the waitress never checked on us. I had the omelet which I found to be over salted (and I love salt) and a ‚Äúsalad‚Äù of mixed greens which were thrown on the plate without any dressing. Strange. I ordered gluten free bread and I got two slices of bread that definitely came out of a package from the grocery store, maybe udi‚Äôs. The butter was so hard and the toast was cold so the butter tore the bread apart when I tried to put it on the bread. We finally got the attention of the waitress and I got some dressing for the salad and my sister got her syrup but we just left without finishing our food anyway. Disappointed
I visited La Grande Boucherie for breakfast before work with a friend. Visiting early was the move because we got to really appreciate how gorgeous the space is. The quiet of the emptier restaurant and the natural light flooding in made the space really shine. Despite the early hour, the staff was incredibly professional and the service was no different than at dinner--the staff are attentive and treat you very well. My friend and I started off with cappuccinos and almond croissants. Both were delicious and I would definitely come back for them. Just that portion of the meal with a friend in the stunning space was worth the trip. I got the avocado toast for my main. The eggs were well cooked and the side salad had a nice dressing to it. My friend got the eggs benedict and also liked her meal. We ended the meal with the mini madeleines which are topped with powered sugar. Having visited for both breakfast and dinner, I prefer the breakfast service. I'll note that I'm a vegetarian so there are more options for me at the breakfast service. I'd love to visit for brunch when the menu is even further expanded. I'm most likely to visit in the future for coffee and pastries in the morning, to try the brunch, or for drinks and an appetizer later in the day.
Birthday Brunch is a big deal so my husband found our spot 6.1/2 St new the Hard Rock Hotel‚Ä¶Adrian was especially gracious to host our table with the elegance deserved. Breakfast selection was top notch. At the end of our French experience, Adrian presented me with a signed hard copy book of the history of the restaurant and a beautiful dessert! I was speechless surprised of the genuine nature of our server and now friend ‚Ä¶. Adrian. Thanks to the host, hostesses and staff for a perfect birthday brunch.üåàüíï‚ò∫Ô∏è
This was my first time at La Boucherie and I will say I was not disappointed! I‚Äôve heard so many lovely things about the restaurant and the various locations - but I heard this midtown location was the best. When you first walk in you are are invited to truly such a grand space. The ceilings are so high giving the space a very Parisian museum-like atmosphere. There is an area outside of the restaurant that you can dine in as well as bar top seating and formal dining in the main area of the restaurant. I sat on the area outside of the main restaurant which was quite lovely. We started with the mussels and the escargot. The mussels were served on this creamy polenta that was delicious. The escargot came out of the shells in a buttery herb sauce. These were probably my favourite!For entrees we both had the filet mignon. It came with mashed potatos and a peppercorn cream sauce. The steak was prepared perfectly! I‚Äôm honestly not a big red meat person but I was pleasantly surprised. Probably the best steak I‚Äôve had in years! We finished with cr√®me br√ªl√©e (we had to) and the tarte au chocolate with gold flakes. Both were simply amazing. Overall, the service was impeccable and we always felt that the staff was there to take care of us. The ambience and overall experience of the restaurant made me feel like I was in Paris! I will be sure to come back soon to try out more on the menu. 
The ambiance of La Grande Boucherie is truly captivating. The restaurant's interior is a perfect blend of classic and contemporary. It is great for both business meetings and date nights. The appetizer menu was great to choose from. I personally went for the Mussels, which was more like a family size appetizer. The drink menu is crafted to French perfection. I highly recommend a summery drink appropriately named La Vie en Rose. The perfect summery mix of sweet, with its Lychee Giffard, and savory with its Lemon, and cranberry Puree. Spiked with Absolut Vodka and Brut Sparkling, it will truly have you feeling like a summer in Paris. The cuts of meat here are top-notch and cooked to perfection.Each dish is prepared with utmost care and attention to detail. I ordered their classic Steak Frites, which was the star of the show. Between the steak itself, the French herb butter, and crisp fries, it truly was a Parisian treat. The Loup De Mer Branzino is another excellent option if you are not into red meat. The fish is cooked to perfection and melts as soon as it is in your mouth. Make sure to leave room for dessert, as the sweet offerings are amazing. I went for the classic Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e and was recommended by our server the Proftieroles, which were absolutely out of this world. Trust me when I say, leave room for dessert!In conclusion, La Grande Boucherie NYC is a must-visit destination for steak lovers and connoisseurs of French cuisine. his restaurant is a testament to fine dining, and it's worth every penny for those seeking an extraordinary culinary journey.La Grande Boucherie is sure to exceed your expectations.
I had a wonderful dining experience at La Grande Boucherie. We were greeted by a smiling hostess who quickly sat us at our table. Then we were immediately greeted by our server and drink order were taken promptly. Then it was time for dinner, I had the Steak Frites. Absolutely delicious! Steak was tender and prepared perfectly. The herbed butter was superb! Overall, a wonderful experience! Will be back on my next trip!
I brought my family who were out of town and they were impressed with everything. The restaurant is beautiful and you can tell they really pay attention to details. I had the steak frites and I loved the herbed butter on top. Overall we left happy and looking forward to our next visit.
I will start by saying that I really wanted to love this restaurant. I read the reviews and noticed some said it was great, while some said it was like an overpriced French food factory with an overwhelmed factory line that simply couldNOT keep up with the volume. I told my daughter about the reviews and said "let's go early enough (4:pm) that we may not experience the challenges they have during peak hours." After all, it looks lovely, you can eat in a lovely heated outdoorsy atmosphere & maybe enjoy fine French food. Well, the waitress immediately told us upon seating "the kitchen covered 1700 plates this morning and they are overwhelmed and changing shifts. I'll see what I can do. I have to work hime te all night so I don't want to upset them." this was in response to ordering apps (4:16 from the late lunch 4:00-4:45pm late lunch menus while they transition to the 4:45 dinner menu so we can order from there). I looked at my daughter and said "as a former thankful waitress that's a big no-no... telling your customers that the kitchen crew in already overwhelmed." With fingers crossed and an optimistic attitude, we ordered mussels, escargot, Caesar's salad, steak Frites, Salmon Proven√ßal, grilled lamb chops, creamed spinach and a burger (for my grankid that LOVES burgers. They served brick hard, likely microwaved bread that literally was frozen into the knife-pressedCut position and the kids could barely eat it. The fries seemed like freezer bag fries, the steak and lamb chops were cooked to order üëçüëç . The salmon was literally raw to the point that it was gelatinous. The waitress noticed and asked if she could take it back to cook it more. üëé mussels were mediocre, tepid and bland. Escargot served shelled in a garlic herb butter was pretty good, the burger was cold. All the sides were tepid at best.
We kicked off our New York weekend with a fabulous brunch at La Grande Boucherie in Midtown. We arrived hungry after strolling from festive Bryant Park that‚Äôs buzzing with ice-skaters young and old. This French restaurant is gorgeous inside and out and boasts of a heated atrium for a cozier dining experience. We enjoyed:Provence Lavender Martini ($19) C√¥tes de Provence Ros√© ($17)French Onion Soup ($18) is why you ought to come here Filet au Poivre ($54): beef filet with peppercorn and brandy sauce Steak Frites ($48): grass fed NY strip topped with herb butter and truffle fries This was a great pick as our opening salvo in this beautiful city. The french onion soup is ooooeyy gooeeey cheesy top-notch! I also particularly enjoyed my filet with the hot peppercorn kick. And of course you can‚Äôt go wrong with their steak frites. Both meats were very tender and flavorful! Truffle fries so crispy we ate them all. Dang we cleaned out the plates! Thank you Sage - we enjoyed our brunch and your friendly service. Be sure to carry around your ID and vaxx card!More pix&vid on IG @i_therefore_conclude
My boyfriend and I frequent La Grande Boucherie whenever we‚Äôre in Manhattan. It‚Äôs so lovely in this restaurant, beautifully decorated, clean, and elegant. The food is always delicious, I highly recommend the Steak Frites, but you can‚Äôt go wrong with anything you get here. The waiters are always so attentive and kind. Tonight we were taken care of by Dorsi, and he was fantastic. Such a friendly face and lovely smile. He made sure we had everything we needed and then some. Always a great night at La Grande Boucherie! 
As usual great food and great ambiance. Attentive and knowledgeable staff. Clean and well organised. Good bathrooms. Nothing not to like... 
The service was great. They were able to get us in without a reservation. The inside dining area is so pretty! The shrimp cocktail is wonderful! The onion soup was wonderful. The steak frites is fine. A bit over priced for what it is. The beef bourguignon was fine, once again overpriced. The profiteroles were a wonderful dessert. Once again the service and setting are wonderful. The food‚Ä¶ they either need to lower the price on some of the dishes or up the quality a tad. Having said that, I would eat there again. I would get onion soup and profiteroles. The place was clean. If you need accommodations for service devices (scooters, wheelchairs,‚Ä¶) you could easily get in and out if the main floor dining area. The air conditioning situation is ridiculous though. It‚Äôs in a building that has both ends open to the outside. There was no air movement and no ac that we could feel. So, if you are susceptible to heat you should go on a cool day.
This is the most delightfully situated open air restaurant in an atrium off W54th Street. It could hardly be better. The service sadly does not live up to the opportunity. It says freshly squeezed orange juice; it is not yet amazingly the waiter thinks it is! Ignorance or incompetence or the belief that the customer doesn‚Äôt matter and should simply be grateful‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.Having arrived before it opened we were kindly asked to wait and they would bring us coffee‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Guess what‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ no coffee, no feedback. At our table coffee arrived and them on putting it down the waiter slipped the coffee into the saucer‚Ä¶.. it can happen no issue here but the reluctance of the waiter to clean the saver was disappointing‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ he should have simply replaced the saucer‚Ä¶.And so it goes on‚Ä¶.. such a shame.Management at serious fault, I have little doubt the staff are simply working with the tools they have‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.do I mean tools or management‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ pun intended!!
La Grande Boucherie is one of my favorite restaurants, hands down. With all the restaurant options in NYC, I still find myself coming here time and time again! The steaks are some of my favorite steaks in the city, and the peppercorn sauce is second to none. On my last visit, I had the Filet au Poivre which was INCREDIBLE. I would have licked my plate clean if I could! The Steak Tartare is also delicious, and I love that it comes with a quail egg. A piece of advice? ALWAYS save room for dessert here! The Profiteroles may be their most popular dessert, and for good reason, but all of their desserts are out of this world delicious. My personal favorite is the chocolate caramel tart!Not only is the food delicious, but the atmosphere is incredible. The restaurant is almost an escape from Manhattan, even though it's right in the heart of midtown. The fresh flowers are stunning, and you can really tell the amount of detail and care that went into each piece of the restaurant's design. It's perfect for all occasions- date nights, celebratory dinners, family dinners, or a night out with friends. I can't recommend La Grande Boucherie enough, and I can't wait to come back again.. and again.. and again!
Let me start by saying Midtown is my least favorite spot to be in Manhattan. However when you have tickets to an amazing Broadway show Caroline or Change you make an exception. La Grande Boucherie is the perfect pre or post theatre meal. You feel like you are transported from the streets of NYC to Paris. The location is in an open delightful breezeway which made us feel safe dining during the covid surge. Restaurant and bar are visually stunning. Attentive service. My daughter and I both enjoyed our meals and will definitely be back for our next Broadway adventure. One thing that really stood out to me was the quality of the glassware. We enjoyed our meal and our time feeling like we were in Paris when travel to Paris is unavailable to us at the moment. Tables are a little too close together for my liking- only reason for not 5 stars. Bathrooms very clean and accessible which is a treat in the city. Would love to go back and have some oysters and Rose' at the gorgeous bar. Highly recommend!
Upon reaching the restaurant, we were immediately greeted with an amazing atmosphere and atrium. The service was on point starting from the hostess all the way to the person who cleans the table.Food was top of the line. We did not expect the escargot to be THAT flavorful and our dishes; the beef bourgonion and duck breast was fabulous. Will definitely be coming back!
Living in NY, I passed this place many times, and I always wanted to go here. So my boyfriend and I finally went and we such a LOVELY time here!! First of all, all the decors were cute and they get beautiful light during the day. We went for dinner and it was romantic. We ordered a lot of food and I loved Escargot(fresh), lamb chop, and black sesame Cr√®me br√ªl√©e.It‚Äôs on the same block as MOMA too so it‚Äôs perfect for not only for locals but also for tourists. 
I‚Äôve had a pleasure of dining at La Grande Boucherie with my husband this month and it was incredible. First of all, the restaurant is big, beautiful and very classy. During lunch it gets pretty loud but we felt comfortable at our table. Because of the location it has more of a business crowd rather than locals or families, I find it a good option for a special occasion celebration or a date. We were seated right away and started with refreshing non-alcoholic beverage. We tried beet salad and their famous onion soup. Both delicious. I found portions quite big. Of course, we had to try meat for main dish. Fillet Mignon was a whole experience - crispy on the outside and melting on the inside. If you‚Äôre a steak lover, I can‚Äôt recommend it enough. For dessert we tried vanilla ice cream, as well as cr√®me br√ªl√©e and we were not disappointed. Waiters were very attentive and we left extremely satisfied.
As a French local, i was impressed by the quality of the food but also by the quality of the service. Alecta and Arbar were very nice to me during my the dinner. I recommend this place to everyone travelling or living in NY. 
It was such a delight having brunch at La Grande Boucherie on a Saturday! It was my first time there, and the first thing I noticed when I entered were the grand interiors‚Äîsuch a beautiful first impression!Ambiance & atmosphere plays such a big role when it comes to the overall dining experience, and this Boucherie location was definitely a very aesthetically pleasing restaurant (Perfect for those who love taking pics!!) I found that this place would be perfect for catching up with friends, family, a date, or even solo dining. My date & I had a great dining experience here! The servers were super friendly, attentive, and efficient‚Äîthey brought out our orders per course and let us enjoy the food/take our time before serving the next dish. I also loved the fact that our server was so game to take my photos, and he had great shots! He knows his thing!Now for the food‚Äîall of the dishes that we had were delicious and full of flavor + presentation was lovely (definitely Instagrammable)!We started off with super fresh east coast & west coast oysters, followed by La Salade de Betteraves au Comte (roasted beet salad) & Les St Jacques R√¥ties (roasted scallops). I love myself some oysters & beet salad at the beginning of a meal, and what we had did not disappoint!Also. I normally don‚Äôt rave over roasted scallops, but I was impressed by the dish! It had interesting flavors and it was satisfying for an appetizer. It was one of those ‚ÄúOk maybe i‚Äôll give that dish a try and see if i like it‚Äù moments‚Äîso glad I did that!I had the Pav√© de Saumon Aux Lentilles (pan seared salmon) for my main course, while my date had the Steak Frites. The salmon was cooked to perfection and the flavors were well-balanced‚ÄîI thoroughly enjoyed it!We ended our meal on a sweet note with the Tarte Au Chocolat/Caramel and Boucherie Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e. The Tarte was my favorite among the two‚Äîit was super creamy, decadent, and the chocolate used was top quality. The creme brulee was also excellent, with a mild sweetness, which is perfect for those who prefer less sweet desserts. We also had a pleasant surprise when our server gave us complimentary dessert champagne!For dessert, we tried the Tarte Au Chocolat/Caramel & Boucherie Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e! The Tarte was my favorite among the two‚Äîit was super creamy and decadent. I always love having some sort of chocolate flavored dessert after meals, so this one hit the spot! The creme brulee was great as well‚ÄîI‚Äôd say this one was more mild in terms of sweetness, so it‚Äôs perfect for those who don‚Äôt want desserts that are too sweet. Our server also gave us complimentary dessert champagne while, which was extremely nice! I also tried the La Vie En Rose cocktail (Absolut Vodka, Giffard Lychee, Cranberry Pur√©e, Lemon, Brut Sparkling)‚Äîreally loved this, it‚Äôs the perf cocktail for day drinking!I‚Äôd have to say that dining here was nothing short of extraordinary. We felt so spoiled and it was really such a lovely time having our brunch date there! I‚Äôd definitely reco this place to everyone‚Äîboth locals and tourists. This is what I feel is one of those NYC must-visit restaurants!
Very friendly and efficient service. Great space that feels like you're "outdoors" & is sufficiently heated to be quite comfortable even on a cold February night. A little pricey for French bistro-type food but everything else about Grande Boucherie makes it more than worthwhile - even for locals!
My husband and I enjoyed a wonderful night out at La Grande Boucherie. He had the 18 oz Dry-Aged Bone-In NY Strip and was in Heaven as it was perfectly cooked. I had the local striped bass and it was super tasty. For appetizers, we had the scallops, the gazpacho, and oysters. All were excellent as were the desserts; the Cr√®me Brulee and the Paris-Brest. For drinks we had the barrel-aged Manhattan, the Le Diable, and a Martini. Each drink was terrific. Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant and can't wait to return. This review is making me hungry. :)
Phenomenal food & even more phenomenal service from Ozzy. Made me feel like a local :)Steak Frites is my go to here.
It probably almost lived up to the hype. Over-crowded. The server we had was very attentive and good fun. As for the steak, we get just as good, if not slightly better, at our local butcher.
This place is perfect for any occasion if you‚Äôre looking for a high end authentic French experience. Be sure to make reservations as this place can get packed! (Which is a sign that the food is delicious). We started off with salmon and escargot for apps that were prepared perfectly tasty. Then went for the lamb and sea bass which was cooked to perfection (see photos) I highly recommend!We tried this absinthe cocktails in particular that are amazing if you enjoy strong drinks, L‚Äôetranger was my favorite. We ended with cr√®me br√ªl√©e and Paris-brest.La Grande is definitely worth the visit in your in NCC or a local for a top notch dining experience
It was my 9th times in NYC. And it‚Äôs always hard to find a beautiful place with amazing food and great service. This place is a perfect spot in the heart of Big City. The food was great. You definitely have to try steak tartar, oysters, steak filet and desserts. I had so much food and I finished it (usually I eat just half of my order). My friend and I had wonderful time there. Also I‚Äôm in love with their Christmas decorations and atmosphere. Our service was great, recommended us drinks, food and was really nice and fast. So if you are in NYC or you are local THIS PLACE MUST FOR VISIT! I Will definitely come back next spring and winter ‚ò∫Ô∏è
It was our first time visiting NYC and we decided to eat here after we attended our Broadway show this past Sunday. Angela was our server and WOW, was she amazing!!! She provided recommendations for the food (French onion soup, mussels, and the awesome mushroom ravioli!) as well as local places to visit while we were here. Super friendly, great food, efficient service! We‚Äôll definitely be back to visit and eat at La Grande Boucherie soon, and we will definitely ask for Angela again!!
I went to this restaurant with my daughter to have a good mother daughter time and enjoy a good food. It was our first time at this place. At first we were not welcomed nicely and warm and offered to sit at the bar even though they had so many tables available! Then we were seated at a tiny table where there were many other tables available. And sadly some other 2 people were seated at a 4 people table! After waiting for a long time we had to ask butter and bread which normally is served without asking! And wish we didn‚Äôt. The bread was super cold and I don‚Äôt know even it was fresh!Then we wanted to try the Wagu burger well done cooked! It was served pretty dry but inside was all red! And we didn‚Äôt complain and tried to enjoy but honestly the whole burger was one of the average below burger I had in my life! My daughter agreed with me and we love burgers but not this one. Especially for the price you pay! It was supposed to come with caramelized onions but I didn‚Äôt have any! Neither my daughter! It is very over priced for the quality!!!! We are not going back there for sure! Our server was nice. I gave a star for him.
Although was a bit of a wait standing in the bar for the table (with reservations), we were seated in a lovely corner table. I had noted it was our anniversary when I made the reservation, and we were treated to a beautiful book about the restaurant and its history. We both had the FILET MIGNON ¬´AU POIVRE¬ª (Pepper crusted beef tenderloin, mashed potatoes and green peppercorn cream sauce) with a side of mixed vegetables. Excellent! For dessert, we had MINI MADELEINES (Citrus and praline madeleines freshly baked) and coffee. Delicious! I highly recommend this beautiful restaurant.
Rodrigo was our server and he was very nice and humorous. My family is visiting New York and we had a great time here. The food was amazing, especially the oysters that were very fresh and delicious.
I like the dessert and red wine here very muchü•∞I want to visit there again, and the steak there is very fresh and tender. I suggest those who like French food go to this restaurant.
We stopped in for an early dinner and drinks. It did not disappoint! The steak frites were done to perfection. Their French onion soup is the best I‚Äôve had in the city. It‚Äôs the perfect cheese for it! Rodrigo recommended the madeleines for dessert and they were fresh and delightful. 
This is a typical upscale French restaurant at New York's most expensive area. La Grande Boucherie is a large place so walk-ins are usually possible. Vibe is relaxing without strict dress code. Food comes as refined and delicate as expected. Scallops are large and full of umami. Clams are fresh. Tomahawk steak is simply satisfying with decadent bone marrow and nice sauces (peppercorn my favorite). Mac and cheese is rich and hearty. Sesame creme brulee comes as the greatest surprise. Service is nice and price well worth it.
Came here to celebrate a birthday. Namik was a great server the entire night. The food was amazing, the filet mignon was perfect, oysters were fresh, and drinks were on point. Must try
Excellent service by Jorge Garcia. The food was divine - the bread was fresh out of the oven. The atmosphere was belle epoque. We had a lovely, lovely time. 
A must go to always. My partner & I absolutely loved our dinner. We always appreciate how detailed and attentive the servers are as well. We enjoyed a couple of dishes and delicious/so fresh!! Let‚Äôs not forget about their onion soup, I adore it, the best ever. We can‚Äôt wait to return. 
I greatly enjoyed being transported to a Parisian restau For the evening. The drinks completed the fresh delicacy of each course. I highly recommend enjoying a meal here. What pushed me over the edge was the rich flavors that were the sorbet; both pastachio and passion fruit left my mouth fresh after such a savory sensory experience. 
Had an amazing time. The tartare was incredible, oysters were fresh and delicious. The food was delicious but the service is what made it for us. I would definitely come back, and request Namik who gave us an unforgettable night. 
The service was prompt and attentive. Our server ensured we had everything we needed and made excellent recommendations. The food was fresh and flavorful. We got the filet mignon and swordfish which were cooked to perfection. 
This beautiful French brasserie is the perfect spot for a date night, family dinner, bday dinner, or group meal! The spacious restaurant with 2 levels have bar seating, oyster bar seating, an intimate dining area, and ‚Äúoutdoor‚Äù options.Don‚Äôt even get me started on the food. They bring out fresh, warm baguette bread with butter to start. I used it to dip everything that I ordered thereafter üòù. Did I mention that the BEST escargots I‚Äôve had in the city was here? It is a must order. I also loved the swordfish and filet mignon (delicious peppercorn sauce). Finally, for dessert, get the PROFITEROLES! It is a flakey pastry stuffed with ice cream and generously drizzled with chocolate sauce. Heaven in my mouth. I will surely be back, and I would also like to check out the sibling restaurants (petit Boucherie). 
My father and his girlfriend took me here to celebrate my birthday. We were struck immediately by the stained glass ceiling and French ambiance of the venue. Our server, Namik, is a legend. Not only is he attentive, smart and constantly moving with elegance to check his n his surroundings, but he goes above and beyond to make sure you feel special. He brought me a gift of the restaurant‚Äôs hard bound book! The food was delicious and we over ate, absolutely. We couldn‚Äôt stop! The seafood tower was so fresh with flavorful side sauces. The filet mignon melted in my mouth and while the veal chop looked like it was cut from a brontosaurus, my father couldn‚Äôt resist finishing it. We didn‚Äôt really have room for dessert but managed some pistachio ice cream that was so good we gobbled it up. Thank you Namik and Le Grande Boucherie for your wonderful service, hospitality and elegance. I look forward to seeing you again soon! 
La Grande Boucherie is the perfect spot with tons of seating so you can almost always grab a table for food or drinks. I had a nice evening in after work with my server Nilton who recommended some great sparkling wines by the glass for me. Make sure you get the oysters too, always super fresh !
We sat at the bar with Sean for lunch and absolutely loved him. My husband and I are from Utah and admittedly don‚Äôt know a whole lot about French cuisine or get out all that often but Sean made the experience so much more enjoyable. The food was deliciously paired with glasses of wine per Sean‚Äôs recommendations. The perfect way to begin our NYC weekend!
We had Dorjay as our waiter and he was super attentive to us the whole night. Excellent service that paired well with the amazing food!
Amazing service by Namik and the whole team at Le Grande Boucherie!Food was amazing for our fifth wedding anniversary. We can‚Äôt say enough about this restaurant!
Excellent quality food. Excellent service - thanks to our waiter Dorji and the whole team. Only challenge is noise level. But will definitely recommend and go again.
Delicious food. Alecta, our waitress, was very polite a kind during the whole of our dinner. She made the experience even much better. We‚Äôll be back!
Food was good and atmosphere was very nice. Server Alecta was fantastic and service was very good throughout the whole meal. 
It was outstanding! It was my first time at la grand Boucherie and I loved it! Nath√°lia was great! She took care of us; she was always around making sure that all our needs were covered. The food came on time and so flavorful! The bacon was so crispy and dry (not oily at all! I need to know how you guys make it!!) the stake came with the temporary that I asked (medium rare) and it came just on point. Very juice, delicious seasoning and in a decent size. The burger was delicious tasty. The fries was so crispy and so yummy! The croque madam was a surprise because I‚Äôve never had it before and I have to tell you all.. you guys have to go to Boucherie to try it there.. it was delicious! Super well balanced and succulent! We enjoyed everything very much. I have to said that the management are doing a brilliant job with the whole team. Alex Gerea made us feel very welcome! Thank you Alex and thanks to your whole team! We appreciate all the service and hospitality! I can‚Äôt wait to go back! I do recommend this place 100%! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Aside from the amazing service (since we walked into the restaurant until we left), the attention to detail and beautiful location, La Grande Boucherie is exceptional for great food and cocktails! I'm extremely picky when it comes to restaurants and would definitely give 100/10! The Filet Mignon was magnificent! Perfectly cooked and good flavor! To start we had the Soupe a L'oignon, one of the best soups I've ever had along with the escargots (Chef's kiss) I also had the Australian ribeye with salad and for dessert (my favorite) the creme br√ªl√©e and the profiteroles! Pure perfection overall! Our waiter was very attentive and was able to explain the whole menu, very knowledgeable, on point with suggestions and very professional! The best espresso martini there is in NYC is at this restaurant, trust meee! Would definitely recommend to start with la Vie En Rose for cocktails! My top choice! Can't wait to go back!
WOW!Honestly, I've walked past this restaurant so many times and have always been so drawn into how beautiful the space is but I've never had the chance to actually go inside until recently dining there a couple of nights ago.First of all, I was a little apprehensive about the possibility of noise as I was going there on a date and I know the acoustics are great (a little too great), but when seated inside (didn't even know there was an inside) it was the perfect spot for a romantic date night.We started with a couple of cocktails, my personal favorite being the Mayan Punch, a great tequila cocktail with a wedge of burnt pineapple inside, consider me sold. For appetizers we shared the octopus and the mussels and as someone who can be a little particular when it comes to mussels I gotta say, these were great. Like, dip my bread in the broth after the mussels were gone great.For entrees we shared the Filet with Truffle Butter (YUM) and the Lamb which was my favorite of the whole meal. The lamb was cooked perfect and with a little potato gratin square on the side and some swisschard it was honestly a perfect plate.We couldn't decide between two desserts, so naturally we ended up with three. Sampling the poached pear, the chocolate tart and the pistachio raspberry pastry, I gotta go with the latter of the bunch. I'm not really a huge pistachio fan but the dessert was so yummy I definitely had more than my fair share.All in all the food was great, service was spectacular (our water glasses never went empty and everyone was so incredibly kind and accommodating) and the cocktails were a hit. 10/10 definitely recommend to a friend!
I frequent La Grande Boucherie for dinner and am happy that they now have a new breakfast menu! While I would recommend their dinner for a special occasion, I would recommend their breakfast for a casual friend hangout. Now that it‚Äôs getting chillier I appreciate the fact that La Grande Boucherie has a heated outdoor area, too. The whole place is so beautiful and I always have an amazing time here‚Äî the food and service has never let me down.
On Wednesday 19th October 2022, my wife and I had the absolute pleasure of dining at this restaurant on 53rd Street.It was a special celebration meal for my wife, who recently had enjoyed a very special birthday. Coupled with the fact she had never visited the US before, let alone New York, I had hoped our meal in this restaurant would be a memorable one, given it was also our last night in NYC, before flying home to the UK the next day.Well, they didn‚Äôt disappoint.The whole experience from start to finish was absolutely perfect. Our only regret was not being able to spend longer with them, as we had booked tickets to a play that night also.The food was outstanding, the ambience was delightful, the service we received from everyone was simply perfect, though we‚Äôd like to say a very special and heartfelt ‚Äòthank you‚Äô to xxx who was our main waitress that night. She was a joy to get to know, even in such a small way. We would like to recommend this wonderful restaurant to anyone and everyone.
The ambiance is amazing and food was OK, but overpriced for the whole experience. Having said that, it is a good alternative for a meal before a Broadway show over some of the tourist traps of the region.
I‚Äôve been there once and the whole experience was amazing. I went with friends and we all loved the food
Fantastic ambiance, an oasis in Midtown. The food was stellar, and the whole experience was memorable. I will be coming back. Our server Jose C did a fantastic job of making my birthday memorable. He went the extra mile.
French gastronomy is famous worldwide for its fine cuisine, with fancy preparations and dishes such as foie gras, scallops, classic mussels, etc. La Grande Boucherie the interior elements at the location, namely the lady statue, the letter "B" on the floor, the decorative elements on the furniture, and the Belle Epoque posters, are a pure masterpiece; it is a location to visit during NYFW, and any other time of the year.
Very rarely do I find a restaurant that has it all and satisfies the palettes of my whole family ( specially my kids ) From cocktails to dessert we enjoyed everything in pure delight. Not only is the staff caring and attentive but the ambiance is a dream. Can‚Äôt wait to return with more friends and family.
I loved the sensual ambiance and thought the service was impeccable. Our server Alecta was wonderful, attentive and friendly without making us feel rushed at all. The food was delicious traditional French comfort food/home style cooking, with rich and balanced flavors, although I found the Easter lamb stew a touch dry. The leek soup du jour was phenomenal.
When I want to feel like I‚Äôm in Paris, this is where I head to. My favorite French spot in the city. Not only does Boucherie have the most authentic French cuisine in the city, but this location `La Grande Boucherie‚Äô is absolutely stunning. A perfect spot for brunch, happy hour (or as they call it "Green Hour‚Äù) or dinner‚Ä¶.it NEVER disappoints. If you‚Äôre an Old Fashioned ü•É lover like myself, this spot has one of the best in town. Now go make those Resys and Bon Appetite! *most of our dinner was comped, but this is my honest opinion and I have paid my way on my own many times here.
We had a lovely breakfast at La Grande Boucherie. The abeyance is exquisite and the staff were so kind. Seated in the corner, we were able to take in the beautiful lighting, mosaic tiles, florals and greens, and it felt like I was transported to Paris! Just what I needed on a gloomy NYC day. To top it off, the almond croissant and eggs benny were five stars, and we finished with a charming dish of madelines. I hope to be back for dinner sometime!
Spent much time searching for a restaurant for a special birthday dinner while in NYC. Based on the rave, solid reviews at Grand Boucherie booked here with confidence. What a disappointment! Bread served before we received any food was of a lovely consistency, crusty on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside but it was extremely salty. Appetizers were just so-so for the four of us but be sure not to order the vol au vent. Anyone who has had a true vol au vent in a legitimate French restaurant will be sorely disappointed, this tasted mostly of a chicken bouillon cube thickened with corn starch. Green salad was uninspired and poorly dressed. Mains arrived. I had the branzino and it had an off taste accompanied with some lack lustre fennel. It was very unappetizing and I told my waiter I just was unable to eat it. He did offer to get me somethibg else but at this point I knew the rest of the party would be finished and waiting on my. I shared some of my husband‚Äôs steak frites and this too was edible but not much more than that. The best part was the French fries and that‚Äôs disappointing to say the least for a much anticipated dinner. I don‚Äôt know if we hit an off night, chose the wrong dishes but I certainly would not return. The quality of the food certainly does not match the very high prices.
Awe man! I'm going to keep this sweet and short as long reviews usually seem fake. This one though is real! My interaction with this restaurant started via email as I was looking to book it for an engagement photoshoot. I was emailed back by a someone named Julia...who was simply awesome in being a professional and accommodating. She gave us the green light to have the photoshoot. Once we arrived at the restaurant, I was greeted first by a florist outside making sure all those real plants in the outside looked amazing for the day. I could've have been turned away then because he did not know who I was and didn't work at the restaurant. But he guided to someone who did worked at the restaurant whose name I did not get to ask for. But he too was very professional and super friendly. He allowed us to wait for the manager and alerted us when he got there. We went on to take the pictures after speaking to Jose, the manager there that day. And after we were done taking pictures. Jose did the most incredible thing. He came to use outside and ask if we would like to stay and get some coffee and team before we left. We gladly said yes and we ended up just staying to have our first meal. The friendliness of the staff there so early in the morning while we were there is unmatched! If you have not been to this restaurant before, you should go. Not just for the food, which is delicious or the deserts, which are even more delicious! But for the service, the only place I've seen such great service was in France. Which makes since since La Grande Boucherie is a French restaurant! 
This restaurant (branch of a small group) occupies a covered atrium along what the City has designated "6 1/2 Avenue." It has the aura of outdoor dining, but is actually in a well-conditioned covered space with a high ceiling. There are more interior tables, but the restaurant has no front wall. I sat at a Hi-Top right where that wall might have been, because I walked-in during a Wednesday Matinee-day lunch. (Not a special menu, just meaning busy day.) In fact, they warned me that there was no Pre-Theater special price menu at lunch. I don't know if the dinner menu is larger or more expensive.I was surprised that the lunch menu wasn't longer. Besides burgers and steaks, and a lot of Brunch dishes (I mean omelettes and quiches), there was a veggie choice and the Salmon en papilotte that I chose. It was well-prepared, with leeks and fingerling potatoes that finished their cooking inside the papilotte with the fish. It was good. I asked my waiter to recommend a dessert, and he suggested Profiteroles. I asked him if they were made every day, and he said yes. They were good, but the vanilla ice cream inside them was not particularly "premium". The pastry was in good condition, but it was not as good a dish as the Salmon.I was happy with my relatively large lunch. But I don't think every Trip Advisor reader is ready to pay over $100 for an (admittedly, substantial in my case) lunch, in an informal seated restaurant. Here's my bill:Glass Viognier wine 18.00Glass Pinot Gris wine 19.00Salmon en Papillote 38.00Green Side Salad 12.00Profiteroles 14.00Decaf Drip Coffee 5.50------Subtotal 106.50tax 9.45Total Bill 115.95My 25% tip 26.00---Total $141.95
I visited La Grande Boucherie with a friend on a Monday evening. Before you even enter the front door, you‚Äôre immediately struck by the beauty of the space. From the lighting to the plants to the outdoor tables, you‚Äôre immediately transported to a French cafe. This continues as you enter to see an expansive bar flanked by a raw bar. As I weaved through the space to be seated at my table, I was struck by the professionalism of the staff - holding the door, moving aside as I passed, pointing me in the right direction. This professionalism continued throughout the meal as our waiter offered many recommendations in line with the food and drink preferences I shared. I enjoyed the La Vie en Rose for my drink, which was sweet, delicious, and a beautiful deep pink. My appetizer was the Salude Mesclun, a mixed green salad with warm goat cheese and apple slices. I had the mushroom ravioli as my entree and the profiteroles, a pastry with vanilla ice cream drizzled with dark chocolate, for dessert. The dessert was the culinary highlight for me, particularly the quality of the dark chocolate. Overall the food was good but not the highlight of the experience. I appreciated that there were multiple entree options for me as a vegetarian. The menu prices are higher than I would expect for the food. As a result I am most likely to return in the future for drinks with an appetizer at the bar to enjoy the ambiance and quality of service. Thank you to the team at La Grande Boucherie for a lovely evening!
A steak pun is a rare medium well done And this steak was a medium rare perfectly cooked! Last night I had an amazing Grabbd App collaboration with La Grande Boucherie and had this beautiful dinner. The staff and service was all nice and attentive. They spoiled me with food and drink! They started me off a drink, the ale Diable (Del Maguey mezcal, Espolon reposado, grilled grapefruit, & cassis) and with bread for the table. I wish I took a picture of the bread of because that butter deserved it! Then I tried the Salade Mesclun Au Cherve Chaud (mixed greens, warm goat cheese on crispy croutons, apples, cherry tomatoes, & candied walnuts). For my main, I ordered the Filet Au Poivre (foley with peppercorns in brandy sauce - ü•∞ no words, just that emoji) with a side of mashed potatoes. Finally, for dessert, they surprised me with a Paris-Brest (a ring of pate e choux with praline moussaline, topped with chocolate) an item not yet officially added to their menu. I actually had to google this dessert because I had never tried it before. My feed may make me look like a pretty adventurous eater but that‚Äôs not very true. I like to try foods usually once, but when it comes to dessert, my rule is no nuts or fruits in it. This one surprised me! It‚Äôs something I never would‚Äôve ordered for myself and didn‚Äôt have an overly powering nut flavor. The pralines added an unexpected crunch to the overall smooth dish. I also found out where it got its name. It‚Äôs named after a bicycle race from Paris to Brest, France and is supposed to look like a wheel.
Wanted to grab a drink after work with my friends, it was Friday and the bar even though it was pretty big was still packed with mostly office people and by the look of it, having a good time, good thing we found a spot to squeeze in and they even have Green hour (happy hour), which is a steal. The place is huge, awesome ambiance and most importantly service was awesome. Bencher was really friendly and attentive even though they look super busy behind the bar. Everyone working really know what they‚Äôre doing.Highly recommend this place.Try La Vie en Rose and Boucherie Old Fashioned.
Boucherie is an upscale brasserie offering classic and elegant French cuisine with 4 different locations in NYC. This location is specifically my personal favorite amongst others, the moment you walk into the restaurant feels like you've been transported to Paris. With stunning decor and a warm welcoming ambiance, La Grande Boucherie offers an extensive wine list and menu items that cater at different price points and eclectic menu offerings. With my last visit at La Grande, I ordered their Saumon D'ecosse (a thinly sliced Scottish Smoked Salmon served with creme fraiche, citrus, and chives), as well as their Salade Ni√ßoise (a mixed greens salad with green beans, confit potatoes, shallots and cherry tomatoes, hardboiled eggs topped with anchovies, and 4 slices of ahi tuna) both light and refreshing perfect for a Starter.For entree, I ordered their massive 48oz. Tomahawk ribeye steak served with roasted bone marrow, bordelaise and b√©arnaise sauce on the side which they said are good for 2 people for which I actually think is good for up to 3-4 people. It was perfectly cooked with a crispy char on the outside and moist/tender center, it was very well seasoned with the beefy flavor really coming through with the minimum amount of juicy fat that almost melts in your mouth as you chew on the meat that compliments very well with my glass of Bordeaux.For Desserts, I had creme brulee and chocolate et caramel tarte which were both up to scratch. Overall, La Grande Boucherie is always a good idea if you are looking for authentic French cuisine. Perfect for date nights, family gatherings, or even for a single diner looking for a 'french' dining experience. 10/10 highly recommend!
I was in NYC for a weekend getaway with the family, so we decide to try this restaurant base on there amazing reviews and decor.. me and my wife love French food and I must say this place didn't disappoint at all.. from the decor to the food and super friendly staff it was a great experience.. We got some great starters - Oysters, Mixed green Salad with Goat Cheese.. Entrees were super good and not to heavy which left room for dessert.. love how attention to detail they are from the host, bartenders, waiters and Aaron the manager was super friendly and recommended the salmon ... I totally will go back soon with my wife.. this is my fav restaurant in NYC!!
This is an enormous French-themed restaurant, partly within and partly adjacent to a pedestrian atrium connecting 53rd and 54th streets. The place was packed last Sunday night. Three of us had pretty horrendous meals. Two "French" onion soups were poor. New York restaurants generally seem to do cracked lobster cocktails really well, with very fresh lobster. Half of mine was edible but not very good. The half inside the claw was a watery mush, and not edible. My coq au vin contained large chicken parts that don't belong in one, but very little meat. I ordered a platter of vegetables, which the waitress described as including green beans and shredded carrots. Apparently, the restaurant had intervening supply chain issues, and we were served cauliflower and broccoli that had come out of a frozen Costco (or similar but lower quality) bag. We did not stay for dessert.This meal was not inexpensive. If you want a French meal in New York, stay away. And if you don't want to pay through the nose, find a nice neighborhood bistro.
I had never heard of Club A but stayed nearby at the Courtyard on 3rd Ave. and decided to check it out as a possible location for a nice family meal with our 3 kids (aged 15, 11, 8). I called the restaurant to ensure it was acceptable to bring the children, they assured me it was and were true to their word. This is a beautiful restaurant in a quiet though easily accessible location. On a Friday night it was full but they honored my reservation and had a great table ready for us. I was impressed by the atmosphere - lately I keep noticing that upscale restaurants especially popular ones can be both too dark and especially too noisy, but Club A was perfectly lit and very comfortable for conversation even though we were seated directly by the live musicians. This was a delightful surprise and the music turned out to be a nice enhancement.We ordered a mix of dishes: onion soup, seafood appetizer platter (crab, shrimp, lobster), T-bone special plus mixed grill for two, organic chicken, and sides of garlic herb fries, asparagus and broccoli. Portions were generous and everything was excellent. We especially enjoyed the seafood (amazing crab meat!) and mixed grill - this is a big and luxurious meal for two if you want to sample what the restaurant has to offer.Service was highly professional and pleasant. The wait for the main course was a little long for the kids but they were gracious about getting us the bill processed promptly when I requested it after that. They also provided a fabulous complimentary dessert plate for our daughter's birthday which was way above and beyond the usual slice of cake.We loved it and hope to return - hopefully without the kids next time!
I wasn't sure what to expect as I have passed it many times but never thought about booking there. The abundance of red color as seen from the street was a bit off-putting but it is always busy. This weekend we made the reservation and was pleasantly surprised. Super-friendly service without being overwhelming. The steak was good and my organic chicken nicely cooked. Good wine list too. I was however disappointed with the French fries which were soggy. How's that possible in this place? Maybe a bad day. They offered us a nice ravioli to start with -compliments from the house- but it was on the cold-ish side.The owner came around greeting everyone and that was a nice touch. The atmosphere was very pleasant with plenty of tourists giving it an international feel. All in all a good experience.
Is always nice to come back to this place, the service is excellent and so is the atmosphere.We started with a Club A Royal Platter with lobster shrimp and crab meat , it was delicious.Then we had Half Lemon Thyme Roasted Organic Chicken and Filet Mignon, both dishes was terrific. It was almost impossible to squeeze in the desserts: cream puffs and the tiramisuThank you for this place Bruno, the owner of this wonderful stekhouse.
Had a family birthday celebration this past Wednesday. I always like restaurants where the owner is usually present, it almost always results in superior service and quality, Club A is no exception. Our reservations were honored and were gracious to a late arriving member of our party. The waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable even with an excellent wine suggestion. Our party had the lamb chops, filet mignons and the New York Strip. All were served as ordered and were absolutely terrific. The owner check stopped by our table to check on our meals and engaged us in conversation over the many photographs on the wall behind us. It was my wife's birthday and the restaurant presented a tray of deserts as well as taking a picture of our table with the owner signing and dating the accompanying frame. We were just blown away by the service, atmosphere and welcoming nature of the restaurant. We would highly recommend it.
My wife and I recently dined at Club A steakhouse to celebrate our anniversary. We arrived a few minutes early for our reservation so we had a chance to hang out by the bar and enjoy the warm fire they have going in the entry area as well as the amazing decorations for the Christmas season. My wife and I both loved the atmosphere! Once we were seated the meal exceeded all expectations. Both of our steaks (we each had the filet) were cooked and seasoned perfectly. We had Mac and cheese and roasted asparagus for the sides which were also delicious, especially the Mac and cheese! I highly recommend it for a side of you like good Mac and cheese! After our meal was finished we were treated to a special complimentary dessert plate displaying a happy anniversary message drizzled in chocolate sauce. The cheesecake was to die for! One of the best pieces of cheesecake I‚Äôve ever had. They also took our photo together with the dessert and Bruno (the owner) hand delivered a postcard sized photo to us displayed with a thank you message that he personally signed himself. He was such a welcoming and friendly man and his character and charming nature resonates throughout the restaurant and staff. Next time we visit the city we certainly won‚Äôt hesitate to visit again! The food was great but the additional friendly and welcoming touch shown by staff and owners is what really makes this place special. Thanks Bruno and staff for a special evening we won‚Äôt forget!
The best steakhouse experience ever!!!Have experienced many steakhouses, but this stands couple of places above all of them. It was just an amazing experience. Everything is top notch here: steaks, sides, menu, service, staff and the atmosphere in general. The owner, Bruno Selimaj is just an amazing person and not surprised why this place is the best. He is so natural, kind and passionate while talking with you and adding that last piece of wonderfulness to this stellar steakhouse. Was together with a group of friends and they were speechless. Can't wait the next time we go to this exceptional steakhouse again, highly recommended!!!
Booked here for a birthday meal for my wife. On arrival we were shown upstairs, which I was initially concerned about but it was fine.Menus brought then bread delivered to the table, closely followed by the wine we'd ordered. I had the thick sliced Applewood smoked bacon to start. Having bacon as a starter is a new concept for me but the two very thick juicy rashers which were brought were a revelation. A little bit of char on the outside but soft and juicy inside - delicious.When we'd ordered, the waiter checked several times that we both wanted a baked potato. When we said 'yes' he checked again, looking slightly puzzled. When the mains arrived we understood. If he'd said the potatoes were that enormous we'd have ordered one, but just a puzzled look on his face didn't communicate what the problem was.I had the New York Strip - 18oz - and it's probably in the top 3 of the best steaks I've ever eaten. Served perfectly medium rare, and cut so thick there could be a nice char on the outside without overlooking the middle. Steak heaven but it defeated me, with a good 4oz still being on my plate at the end.We declined dessert, being stuffed, but they brought out a plate with a selection of 5 small desserts on, which proved too nice to totally resist.Service is very attentive but the nature of the upstairs room, the part towards window section, is relatively narrow and for staff to see how your meal is progressing they have to come right up behind you. As they were checking on tables around us, as well us, it felt like there was forever a waiter hovering over your shoulde. It's a little offputting but I don't know how they can avoid it, given the layout of the room.A very smart restaurant and not cheap, but good value given the quality of the food.
I did my research before choosing a fine dining spot for our last night in New York. Club A Steakhouse received rave reviews, and now I understand why! Not only was the establishment beautiful and romantic, the service was superb. One can get great food in a lot of places, but service such as we received is quite rare. We walked in and were immediately greeted. We had reservations but ended up about 15 minutes early. Without having to wait, we were seated at a table upstairs. Both the upstairs and downstairs have a small bar. Each table had a fresh red rose and candlelight and fresh linens. The walls and ceiling are decorated in a deep rich red. There are mirrors on the walls, which makes the restaurant seem bigger than it is. The view from our seats was outdoor trees with white lights. Our server was patient and friendly, answering all of our questions about the menu. I never felt rushed. We ordered cocktails before dinner and wine with our meal. I asked our server to bring whatever cabernet he thought was good (I didn't feel like laboring over a wine list). I don't know what he brought me, but I ended up ordering another glass of it! After our salad (which was light and refreshing) we were brought a complimentary appetizer. It was a portabella mushroom ravioli that was to die for. It was in a cream sauce. Our steaks were excellent and perfectly cooked. I had the filet mignon and my husband had the hangar steak. I also ordered the truffle mac'n'cheese and he ordered mushrooms. The mushrooms were so delicious he ate the entire serving (which is enough for 2-3 people). During dinner I was brought my second glass of wine and my husband also ordered a glass of what I was having. We were told this glass was on the house. After our meal we chatted with the waiter and had a conversation about California (where we're from). I liked how natural our conversation felt. We enjoy talking to people and sometimes when we converse with the wait staff at restaurants, we feel rushed, like they need to get to another table. Not here. Our dinner plates were cleared and while we were enjoying our wine, we were brought dessert. Also complimentary! It was a delicious combination of cheesecake, profiteroles, tiramisu, and berries. During our meal, we saw the owner walking around, smiling and checking on people. On our way out, we stopped to tell him how wonderful our experience was. He was so kind and humble. He offered to buy us a drink at the bar. We kindly declined (only because we were stuffed).The entire dining experience, from the minute we walked into Club A until the minute we walked out, was superb. I cannot recommend this restaurant enough. There are plenty of steakhouses in New York, but it's worth the time and effort to make Club A Steakhouse your choice.
Recently went on our first trip to NYC and was looking for a nice place to go on our last night, based on trip advisor rating and reviews we booked Club A and were absolutely not disappointed!We were seated on the first floor and opened with a glass of Veuve Clicquot (our champagne of choice) - a reasonably priced $22 each (considering the cost to import it to the US).I had the snails to start and asked the waiter how "pernody" they were - I'm not a huge fan of aniseed. He said it is very understated and he was right - a beautiful garlicky butter was the main flavour. My girlfriend opted for the lobster cocktail which is in effect half a lobster served in the shell with salad etc. Always enjoy cracking into a whole claw! I then opted for the 16oz filet mignon (cooked blue), my girlfriend the 18oz New York Strip (med/rare) with sides of fries, asparagus and mushrooms.My 16 oz steak was incredible - cooked (or should I saw not cooked) perfectly. It was very slightly over seasoned but only on the seared edges where the nature of a blue steak gives it little time to spread to the rest of the meat! The strip was also cooked perfectly and tasted divine.Sides were delicious although we barely touched them as we were focussed on eating of the steak as we could!I had a beer (Duvel) and Jen moved onto the red wine - one of her favourites is Malbec and it is served by the glass here. She had a second glass as well which accidentally got mixed up with a pinot noir order from another table - we were not overly concerned and didn't comment, although the other diner with the Malbec instead of a pinot was very vocal and rude about it! Frankly we were both too full to really consider a dessert but the very warm and friendly owner, Bruno, provided us with a trio of desserts as well as a large fruit selection - he also wanted to make sure we enjoyed our last night and offered us more drinks so I had a Baileys and Jen an Amaretto.The waiting staff were attentive and knowledgeable without being overbearing or cold, Bruno is a lovely gentlemen who again was not overbearing but clearly enjoys interacting with his customers and ensuring they are completely happy - he clearly lives to serve.We asked for the bill and were surprised that not only was the dessert and spirits not billed, but also the wine and beer. This was neither asked for not expected but is of course a lovely touch and one which encourages positive comments! I should stress that we were absolutely happy to pay full price for our meal - it would have been worth every penny - Club A/Bruno clearly feels that he is in a position to treat his customers to VIP treatment at the expense of a couple of extra dollars and it is a lovely and touch.On leaving we were given our coats and thanked again for our visit and given best wishes for the rest of our holiday and our flight to Antigua the next day...just as I was leaving Bruno grabbed me and handed me a long stem red rose (pulling the thorns off with his fingers) for me to give to Jen...another lovely touch.In summary - is this the best meal I've ever eaten anywhere, no, but then I have been fortunate to eat at the Fat Duck, is it one of my happiest and memorable dining experience and a fitting end to our first trip to New York, absolutely. If we are lucky enough to return to New York in the future, we will absolutely return to Club A Steakhouse, I cannot compliment it highly enough.
I searched for a dinner choice on TripAdvisor recently while in Midtown NYC for business. Based on my location, Club A came up highly rated. TripAdvisor never usually let's us down, and this choice continued the good reputation!I came in early (5:00PM) and no one was there, and all staff were very polite and helpful. I was seated in a primary location on the second floor overlooking 58th Street. The music was fun and lively and the environment was very nice. I was soon joined by some young couples, and another single businessman.The waiter explained the simple 'steakhouse" menu and the specials. I ordered the Tuna Tatar special appetizer and the Filet-on-the-Bone special entre. A class of Italian wine complimented it nicely. The Tuna was tasty, but nothing memorable, I prefer raw tuna in larger simple pieces, more like Sashimi. This was a little over processed, but served with a fresh mixed green salad and some chopped onion. The √Ä la carte Filet was cooked just as I ordered, but was larger than I really wanted - but I suppose that's the nature of a steakhouse. The Filet was crispy outside and flavorful inside. I also ordered the saut√©ed spinach, which was still slightly crispy - which I liked. It also was not overly garlicky.The service was very good. I noticed at the fellow next to me, that when his food arrived he wasn't sure he liked the side he ordered. The waiter and his assistant went out of their way to ensure that the customer had what he wanted, even it meant replacing the side ordered.I ordered a second glass of wine, when they brought a "complimentary" dessert: mini cannoli, tiramisu, and chocolate cr√®me puff. The cr√®me puff was out of this world! It tasked like a light Beignet filled with light chocolate cr√®me - yummy! This is definitely on my list when I return.
Not even worth the time to write this review.First they wanted to sit three of us at a very small table that was actually a table for two with a third chair stuck in on the side. When I requested a larger table I was told they didn't have anything but would check downstairs to see what they could do. As we arrived at our table downstairs (a table for four) we noticed six other tables for four that only had two people at them??!!?? I can't understand why they were trying to squeeze us at such a small table when there was plenty of room.The food was mediocre at best. My hangar steak came out pre-sliced which was not mentioned on the menu and very upsetting. I know why restaurants pre-slice steak, it's because it looks like a larger portion when it's sliced and each piece is laid on its side. When I asked why my steak was pre-sliced the waiter ignored my inquiry and returned to the kitchen. Not only was there no natural juice on my plate because I didn't cut into it myself, the steak was as tough as leather.Overall the food wasn't as bad as the service but I wouldn't return for either.
20/9/2014What a great experience we had!Honestly, I and my fianc√© came here with another couple with the specific purpose of enjoying steak in New York. We had amazing experience with the following top three: Atmosphere excellent! Steaks wonderful! Service excellent!Atmosphere very American: soft lights but table well illuminated makes the your table warm saving your privacy. The tables are large and comfortable and there is much room between other tables. Steaks: women had mignon filet whose were very tasted but a little bit dry (they were medium cooked, rear were probably better), I and my friend shared a classic New York steak, (medium rear) which was very soft, delicious and juicy and a prime rib eye steak (medium rear) which was sooo soft and tender, while the taste was more intense than the New York steak (both delicious).As side dishes we tried spinach, broccoli and potato (all good).Service: attendants were always proactive and very helpful for suggesting the pest options and providing with information about the meat and wine or other. The way of the brought to our dishes all together for each person was impressive!Last but not least, we had many complementaries all along the dinner: just after placing the order (steaks and side dishes) they gave us ravioli with mushrooms, while after the meal we were offered with fresh fruit (very nice presentation) and desserts (tiramisu, cheesecake, profiteroles...). All of these were as complementary from the house... The only negative point, was the lack of good options of wines from Italy. They have good wines from US and France, but honestly there were not a good choice of Italian wines (to be improved).This long comment just to say: it is expensive, but you are in New York, if you want to enjoy a real New York dining experience about steaks, come here!
Having read a lot of positive reviews for Club A, we thought we'd give it a try, and ultimately we weren't disappointed. The restaurant is very traditionally decorated, and is definitely winter place - roaring fires, muted lighting and a sense that you're eating a steak in 1930s NYC. The steak is excellent, beautifully cooked and very good portions. The herb fries and the mash potato were great, and my fiance's salmon was also well cooked and tasty. They provided us with a complimentary desert, which was a nice surprise and the service was generally good. One thing I would flag is that it took a while to get a wine list and to order some drinks after we sat down, which was a little disappointing, but that is a very minor point.In terms of cost, a meal for two here with wine is not cheap (so be prepared), but it is worth it for the quality meat and also the atmosphere. 
I booked this restaurant well in advance of our trip from Scotland and I am so glad I did. We were celebrating my fianc√©'s 30th and our engagement. We were given a lovely table upstairs by the window. The host was very welcoming and saw us to our table and the rest of the staff were also excellent. We had a complimentary mushroom ravioli to begin, which was delicious! For our main we shared a porterhouse for 2, it was easily the best steak we have ever eaten! We shared two sides and that was enough. My fianc√© is still going on about how good the onion rings were, and the garlic and herb fries were outstanding! We couldn't manage it all but the waiter gave us the leftovers to take home. We also got complimentary dessert which was lovely. The host also took our picture and we were given a printed copy to take away. One minor niggle we had was that our friend in Scotland phoned the restaurant to ask for a bottle of champagne to be given to us and we didn't get it, we only found out afterwards! Perhaps some crossed wires. Can't find fault in the food and service, it deserves its high rating and is a very special restaurant! The prices are reasonable for what you get too, compared to the UK. We will return when we are back in NY! X
Had read the reviews on here before we attended so knew we were in for a treat on our final night. Knowing how large the main course would be i went straight for the main and had the Prime dry aged rib eye 24 oz steak, my girlfriend had the lobster ravioli and we shared the three sides with onion rings garlic bread and garlic herb fries. Between the steak, fries, onion rings and garlic bread i have never had any better and my girlfriend agreed about her ravioli!Got given a few extra complimentary bites and had a bottle of red as well and all for a very reasonable price compared to meals we are used to in the UK.Fabulous service, very friendly staff.A must visit!
We were a party of 9 that celebrated my boyfriends birthday at Club A Steakhouse last Friday. We were seated upstairs and with the lighted tree view from outside, I found the ambiance to be very romantic! I wish I remembered our server's name but let me just say he took great care of us along with the manager on duty that always made rounds to make sure everything was good. For appetizer, we ordered a slice of bacon, crab cakes, oyster (tasted so fresh), tomato and onion. We ordered six sides and did family style which was just enough for all of us: Garlic herb fries, potato puree, truffle mac & cheese, asparagus, mushroom, spinach which were all delicious. I personally ordered the filet mignon - medium rare. It was good especially with the Club A steak sauce (must order, I'm not a big fan of steak sauce but that was beyond tasty) but I actually liked the rib-eye much better. Don't get me wrong, I still devoured it. As we were eating all you can hear was "this is so good" - I guess it's safe to say that everyone enjoyed their meal. The only downside was my boyfriend came for the Kobe steak but apparently it's not always a available (call ahead so no disappointments). He was really looking forward to that and was pretty bummed. To end our meal, they brought not one but two complimentary plates of assorted desserts. The cheesecake was so good, I've never had a plain cheesecake taste that good! To top it off, since it was a birthday celebration one of the staff members took a picture of our table and printed it out for each couple which was taped on the "birthday menu" --- Thank you!
We came here to celebrate my 30th birthday and we were also on our honeymoon so we wanted something special and Club A delivered. Ambiance: after reading reviews we made a booking through open table and asked to be seated in the main dining room downstairs. This was definitely the preferred location. Prior to being seated we had our coats checked in. The decor of the room was red walls with framed photos tastefully decorated. The table was lit by candles, there was a rose and nice place setting. This created a soft, moody and romantic feel. The dining room would only sit maybe 60 people and everyone was there for a nice dinner so there was not the feeling of a loud and rowdy steakhouse. Definitely perfect for a romantic dinner. Service: was wonderful. Our waiter was polite, friendly and attentive. He told us about the specials and suggested recommendations but was never pushy. When he wasn't around someone else would make sure our water glasses were never empty. This was great service. My husband prefers medium rare steak and I prefer well done and even though we got a 2 ppl shared platter, the chef managed to cater to our requests. Overall service was efficient and top notch. Five minutes after we sat, our order was taken, 10 mins then our complimentary entree came and immediately after our mains followed by dessert. Service was spot on!Food: food here was excellent. The complimentary mushroom entree ravioli was soft and creamy. The steak was succulent and cooked to perfection. My FAVOURITE however was the herb garlic fries which is a must try. Just WOW - best fries ever!! The dessert which was complimentary once again was delicious. A shared platter of cheesecake, tiramisu and profiteroles were just beautiful. The extra mile: knowing it was my birthday and a special occasion, the dessert platter had a candle and Happy Birthday message on it. We also had our photo taken and later printed with a letter from the owner. Nice touch!Overall our bill came to $165 for two inclusive of the 20% full tip. Yes, it's not cheap but nor is it outrageous. For a special occasion and a place like New York for a 3 course meal, I think it's reasonable and should we be celebrating again in New York, I'd definitely return. Thank you Club A for a wonderful night!
I came here in search of a fantastic steak and after hearing so many good things about this place, I decided to make a reservation. This place certainly did not disappoint as they offered both the best steak I have ever had along with the best service I have received anywhere.When I checked their menu online I saw that they offered a 28oz American Kobe Tomahawk Ribeye for $99, which I was really looking forward to. Unfortunately the menu is outdated and they no longer serve Kobe beef, so I was recommended an 18oz prime dry aged t-bone steak, which isn't listed on the menu, instead. It is definitely worth asking for recommendations in this place as there can be items like this that aren't listed on the menu, but the staff inside are really knowledgeable about the food that they serve and will be able to make fantastic recommendations.I opted for two courses, starting with the calimari fritti and the previously mentioned steak, along with a side order of the garlic herb fries.The portion size for the calimari was absolutely massive, coming in at about three times the size I was expecting, which meant that I felt there was decent value to be found here. The calimari was really nice as well, which is a plus as there are so many restaurants that don't know how to prepare calimari correctly. It came with a sauce, which complimented the calimari well and a lemon for you to squeeze on yourself as you please, which is always a good thing.The steak itself was absolutely incredible and was by far the best steak I have ever consumed in my life. I ordered it cooked to medium and it was really juicy and tender, especially the filet mignon, which really melted in your mouth. The blend of different flavours from the dry aging process such as the hints of blue cheese helped to make a steak that was cooked to perfection. The garlic herb fries were really nice as well. I'm not usually a fan of french fries, preferring the thicker cut, but these were really good given what they were. The herbs helped to give enough seasoning to them that salt or pepper wasn't at all necessary to improve the flavour.There were also two complimentary courses served. Lobster ravioli was served between the starter and the main, while a small slice of tiramisu was served alongside a large profiterole for dessert. Much like the rest of the food, both of these complimentary dishes were really good and they could not be faulted.The service in here was absolutely exquisite. Not only was water served without needing to ask for it, but it was topped up whenever you drunk half the glass. It also came with ice as standard, which helped to keep the drink cool throughout the duration of your meal. The host was really knowledgeable about the food that was being served and would talk you through each course. He was really friendly as well and more than happy to engage in conversation.It may appear small from the outside, but the restaurant extends really far back and there are a lot of tables available in the restaurant with seating both downstairs and upstairs, where there is also a bar. There's a really nice setting to the place with the low lighting and the red walls, which are adorned with pictures of famous people, who have presumably dined at the restaurant. Slightly off-putting was the fact that one of the members of staff was stood hovering so close to the table as he monitored the room for diners in need of service. Personally I felt that this would have been better done at a distance instead of right under your nose.The value of this place is alright. It might be expensive, but at the end of the day you get what you pay for in the quality of the food. The service charge really does drag up the price of this place, coming in at around 20%, so it's something you need to be aware of when dining.
Friday night. Our anniversary . The jazz was played, the million little light were on the tree seen from the glass wall. The food was served by the nicest waiter. We had a shmoos. He is from Albenia. A very educated young man. He was delightful. Than the food was served in a beautiful way. We shared a rib eye that was done perfectly. We had herbed fries and asparagus, and spinach .The owner, Bruno, came over to ask if everything was ok, .we told him it was iur anniversary and right away a young woman came with a camera and took our photo. After a few minutes she came and handed us our photo. Than we were offered, on the house, a plate with three different sweet cakes, all were delicious.
Went here for a special occasion. We were taken promptly to our table, given water and they took our drinks order. Our waiter was very attentive for the entire evening. Had the Lobster cocktail to start, which was a bit of hard work, but very tasty. Free mushroom ravioli to follow, which my partner ate (damn that pesky mushroom allergy of mine). Our mains were the fillet steak & Hangar steak, with creamed spinach, asparagus and garlic herb fries. The steak was absolutely amazing, mine was lovely and grilled on the outside but perfectly rare inside, my Husbands' hangar steak was so juicy, I kept eating it . Sides were good, the star of the sides was the creamed spinach, I could eat that everyday, absolutely amazing. A trio of free desserts followed. Amazing. Great place and seriously tasty food.
We made an on the day booking after looking at reviews on trip advisor for dinner. We were on holiday from Australia and it was my husband's 40th Birthday. We had a lovely table upstairs by the Window. The restaurant decor and atmosphere is perfect. The music playing all night was classic artists and set a very relaxed environment. Our waiter Donnie was friendly, efficient and knowledgeable. We ordered Mains, Filet Mignon and Lobster Ravioli with herb fries and saut√©ed broccoli. Everything was fantastic. We had a glass of Peter Lehman Shiraz which was perfect. Before the mains came out we were given complimentary Mushroom ravioli as a starter. Sooo good. Then after main we were given complimentary dessert which was like a tasting plates of sweets with Happy Birthday written plus candle. This was followed with a photo taken by the restaurant and printed for us to take away. Finally the owner Bruno came to see us for a quick chat and to sign the photo. We were blown away. This was the type of treatment you would expect if you were a regular customer not a 1st timer. We could not rate this restaurant highly enough for service, food, atmosphere. Five stars across the board. Thanks to Club A Steakhouse for making my husbands 40th Birthday in New York one to remember. 
We went there for our last evening in the city, just to get a good steak, driven by recommendations. And our experience was top. A very warm welcome, a nice table, and a very friendly and attentive waiter. We had calamari and crab cake as a starter, the calamari were really good, coming with a spicy tomato sauce, the crab cake was freshly made, I would have preferred more sauce and spicy seasoning, but it was good. Our steaks were perfectly cooked, the sides werde fresh and tasty (I never had french fries seasoned with herbs and garlic). We had no more space for any desert... The wine list could be overlooked, with focus on Californian wines, we had a good bottle of Zinfandel. Wen spent there more than 200 bucks which is much money, but comparing it to other premises in NYC and the quality, it was even worth the price. The owner came twice and asked for satisfaction, and it was not noisy there. So this restaurant invites me to come back when I will be in NYC for the next time, definitely one of the best.
I hesitate writing this review only because I don't think I can do the restaurant justice. Went to NY for a long weekend with another couple, each of us chose a restaurant. Being an avid hunter and steak man, Club A Steakhouse was my husband Ken's choice.We all have traveled, have eaten at some very nice restaurants, and Club A Steakhouse was not only our #1 vote in NY, but also CA, LA, FL, etc. Club A's Owner and staff have an uncanny way of balancing a 5 star restaurant atmosphere, service & menu, with a downhome relaxing atmosphere. We started of with Tomato and Buffalo Mozzarella. To our surprise, after we had finished our appetizer, the chef then sent out a free mushroom ravioli for us all to try. My husband doesn't particularly care for mushrooms, but he liked this! We then were each served our steaks. The men ordered Filet Mignon off the menu, the ladies an aged T-bone from a special they were having that evening. Melt in your mouth flavorful steaks - each and every one of them. The sides were also delicious; Garlic Herbs Fries, Whipped Yukon Potato Pur√©e, and 5 Cheeses Truffle "Mac". The service? Our waiter was so helpful and attentive. But, wait, I don't think we had just one person watching out for us, but several. If a wait staff saw something that needed to be done, it was done. A+++ service. We were all so full, but with everything tasting so wonderful, we just had to try dessert-which was complimentary!Bruno is our kind of guy. It's obvious he takes his business, customer service, and most importantly, family very serious. He brought around 2 of his grandchildren in between courses. You can tell they are the apple of his eye. If he balances family as well as he does his business, he will leave a lasting legacy.Two regrets: we didn't get a picture with Bruno before the evening ended, and we didn't have time while in NY to have another meal at Club A Steakhouse. We will definitely recommend to all our friends visiting NY, and will definitely return when visiting NY again.
We had a wonderful time at Club A Steakhouse. We had a 6:30 reservation on Thursday, December 26. When we first arrived, there were very few people there. We ordered our food at 6:45 and did not get it until 7:48. However, we had a glorious time waiting for it because the environment is incredibly warm and friendly. Everyone was having a fantastic time and it was incredibly romantic, as well. A very kind Finnish couple was sitting next to us and shared their bottle of wine! We received dessert on the house, because of our wait for dinner. And then, as we were leaving, the manager even offered us a drink at the bar. The food was phenomenal. I had the french onion soup, and then my husband and I shared the mixed meat platter. We also did the side trio (herb fries, truffle macaroni and cheese, and german hash browns.) This does not include the 3 excellent martinis we had before dinner arrived. We truly had a wonderful time.
I booked this up about a months a go, we booked up for Friday 29th of November, as I knew it would be busy the day after Thanksgiving. I requested at the time if we could have a window seat near the pretty lights on the second floor. When we arrived we were greeted very pleasantly. We were shown to the table, the restaurant was full, so good job we booked. As requested I was sitting right where I wanted to sit, which was nice. We skipped starters, as I prefer to have desserts! The waiter pre-warned us that due to our steaks being requested at well done and not having starters, that we may have to wait for half an hour, which we didn't have a problem with, as that is usual for steak, we chatted away with our wines, then they came up with two plates and said this is complimentary. They served us with a lovely sauce over a mushroom, it was yummy, the flavour was perfect, it was a small portion, it was just right, the strange thing is both my husband and I don't like mushroom, but we both enjoyed it‚Ä¶! Our fillet steak came up and it looked tasty. There was a crispy effect on the outside and well cooked and soft in the middle, it one of the best steak I have ever tasted. We had herb fries with it and they complimented each other. The dessert is a nice surprise..! Not telling ! The atmosphere was great, the waiters were fab. We weren't rushed, it was a very nice place indeed. I will only have steak here if ever come back to New York! If you appreciate a good steak, this is the place to come.
Like most people I booked based on the reviews. On arrival it took a little while to be shown to our table, but no big deal. Ordered a couple of glasses of champagne while we looked at the menu. We were skipping starters and we were happy about that as they bring a lovely bread basket and a complementary mushroom ravioli which was really nice. We ordered fillet steaks with sides of garlic herb fries, onion rings brussel sprouts sauce for my steak and my husband wanted garlic butter, not on the menu and waiter said that should be fine. When the steaks arrived they looked VERY charred on the outside, the inside looked ok, but my husbands was really dry. His garlic butter hadn't arrived and when he called the waiter over, it was obvious he'd forgotten about it He said it was In the kitchen...to which my husband replied, well could I have it with my meal? The sides were below par. They brought a nice dessert as we were celebrating and a complementary drink, which was very nice of them. They also didn't charge for our bottle of wine. All this said, maybe my expectations were too high. The ambience was lovely and it was great to meet the owner, however Club A Steakhouse should be able to cook steaks to perfection....it's not difficult.
I must say I'm very disappointed.. it's not my first experience in a steck house in NY City but it wasn't as good as I hoped it to be. Must say the reviews were good as well.I went there with 2 friends and my sister, as a respect to her BF who just visited NY for the first time. We had reservations so we didn't wait at all, we set kinddda in the middle so it was a bit loud. It was also very dark, I couldn't understand if it was for the need of drama or trying to save on electricity bill... Anyway, food- I ordered a steck and a side of asparagus and shared a side of Mac and cheese with my sister, it was supposed to be an appetizer but it came along with the food, mistakes - we all do them it's fine... We had to open with their braed platter that was very fine.You would think, how can you ruin asparagus plate? Or a nice piece of stack? Well yeah you can, very easily.The stack was dry to death, I asked medium, there was nothing medium about it. The Mac and cheese had more oil than the oil tank the fry the French fries in, it was a short way to painful heartburn.The poor asparagus was soaked with oil as if it was water. So even if you wanted to get a little bit health from eating veggies, nope you can't.The waitress realize something was wrong but he was very busy and I choose not to bother him with that, after all it seemed like a pattern.He gave us samples of 3 desserts, it's the first time that I could stick to my word of skipping dessert. Not cause I wanted, cause it was horrible. We got some type of dough dipped in guess what?! Yup! Oil! Some cake that I guess was supposed to be a cheesecake, but it wasn't. A dissaster!So why 2 starts after all? The service.The Service was rally wonderful! You can see that the waitres work there for many years, they know what they need to do, and they were really nice. They deserve it all.Don't think I'll ever go back to this stack house, at least not when I worry about the amount of oil I'm consuming.
We visited here for a second time during a second trip from the U.K. We always go as a 4 with a young baby and they have always been very accommodating with endless amounts of bread for the baby to chomp on, making arrangements so we can make a bottle and arranging high chairs promptly. They waiters are hot and have always been very friendly and welcoming. They give you a complimentary small starter which is a nice touch. They are prompt in serving you and happily cater to your every need. To anyone trying to decide whether or not to give it a try, do, you won't regret it. The food is delicious as are the sides. The other 3 people I eat with have tried many many steaks and say undoubtedly this is the best. I however try to avoid red meat due to my health and I discovered they occasionally do this mushroom stuffed pasta as a starter, once discovered each time we have visited I have requested this as my main. They were happy to accommodate and it's the best pasta I've ever eaten, I seriously think it should be put on the menu for vegetarians who are eating there to accommodate friends. It's to die for. The sides are all very good and full of flavour.... I hate sprouts usually but here they are a must. The atmosphere is very relaxing with dark red walls and candles on the tables. The best place to eat in New York.... Trust me.From your English steak fans and baby bread muncher. Thanks for great service! 
We had reservations at Club A Steakhouse a few weeks ago and walked over expecting to enjoy a nice dinner - based on all the reviews we read on Trip Advisor. When we arrived at the door, we were greeted with a sign noting the rating for this restaurant was a "C". Now, with all the A's and B's from a cleanliness perspective, we couldn't stay. I wish TripAdvisor added in the health rating. I checked online after the fact and noted that Club A definitely has received a C - one of two restaurants in the zip code with such a low rating. So, be aware.
When it comes to meat and fire, any one can do it. The pros make the experience worth the down side to your health and heart. This place poorly cooks inferior meat, joins it with soggy fries, soupy spinach, but great service. If only those friendly waiters had something worth eating to serve. If you are not mindlessly grazing and take your eats seriously, seek meat at reliable and well known locations in and around NYC. Do not waste your cholesterol intake here.
I came to Club A Steakhouse on a limb. Me and my fianc√©e have been going to Gallagher‚Äôs for years to celebrate birthdays but I wanted to try something new this year. This place DID NOT disappoint. The restaurant is beautifully decorated for the holidays both outside and inside. The atmosphere inside is elegant, classy, and warm, everything a good restaurant should be. Beautiful and carefully considered ambience, especially to enjoy a night out in NYC during the holiday season. We were seated and our waiter, Nick, was so attentive and warm. He was really honest about how much he thought we should order and his suggestions were perfect. There are so many generous touches that undoubtedly makes this place the best dining experience I‚Äôve had in NYC (I‚Äôve lived here for 25 years). They brought out complimentary ravioli which was SO GOOD (even 2/3 of us who hate ravioli licked the plate clean). They finished off the night giving us a free dessert platter and let me tell you, this dessert wasn‚Äôt just a plate of stale assorted pastries they had to get rid of. Everything on the plate was absolutely delicious, some of the best dessert I have ever had. The owner,Bruno, was so attentive and lovely. He took it upon himself to make sure everyone was having a good evening and checked in with care and warmth. All our food was delicious, steaks were cooked EXACTLY as we had asked, seared perfectly, perfect temperature, perfect seasoning. The sides were also delicious. We couldn‚Äôt believe the generosity and hospitality but I expect no less from my Albanian compatriots. Best night out we‚Äôve had in a long time.
Romantic clean location, friendly personal service and real good food especially steak That is, what we want from a good restaurant If it‚Äôs worth, we love to pay a higher price like at this spot 
Having seen the highly rated reviews and the overrule TA rating, we thought this would be great place to celebrate my wife‚Äôs birthday when in NYC. Booking was so easy and the emails flip flopped over the pond. We were all booked and set.Arrived and were promptly greeted and taken to a table on the first floor in the window, so we over looked the street and it was really nice. Crisp clean white table clothes were set on the table and the waiter came over and introduced himself. My wife‚Äôs menu said - happy birthday on the top, how nice!!Started with a nice Argentinian Red Malbec which was very nice. (However when I can buy this at home for sub ¬£10 inc tax I think $60 is a bit rich).Now on to the food, we were not disappointed.From salads to tartare, from a fillet to a ribeye, all were perfectly cooked.Then we were presented with a plate of deserts for my wife‚Äôs birthday. Coffee was Luke warm and could have been a lot better, but overall an excellent meal, in good surroundings and which we enjoyed.The bill was $260 for wine, water, 2x starters and 2x main courses plus the request for 18-25% tip. Sorry were from the UK so if we‚Äôre really really really happy you will get 10%. If you need more ask your employer for it!!Would I return, yes I would, it was really good.
I took my family to it . It was the first time to us there . Awesome steak , clean place and very friendly staff . I would definitely recommend it .
Food was delicious and exactly as ordered. Incredible Porterhouse for 2. Service went above expectations. The owner Bruno visited each table on more than one occasion to be sure everything was perfect. Club A was clean with a wonderful view and atmosphere. Can't wait to return.
We found this restaurant through trip advisor and what a fantastic place. As soon as we got into the restaurant we we were met by friendly staff that showed us to our table without having to wait. The restaurant is clean and well set out and the waiting staff are great. I can not praise this place enough it‚Äôs everything you would expect and more the food was great and the owner is keen to meet his customers and engauge with conversation. Awesome and thank you Very much for a great evening. We would love to come back soon.
Double 60th Celebration - we had went with another couple, close friends to celebrate our husbands big 60th. We are so happy that we came here. Beautiful decor with live music (not too loud- even though we sat close). Great service, the manager had came over a few times to chat, wonderful hospitality, our waiter was very attentive - old school service. We all loved our food, from apps to dessert. We were given a free small ravioli appetizer which was delicious. I was happy with the raw oysters, very clean; we also had the caprese salad and fried calamari, also very good. We had been to many great steakhouses and this one has become my number one. The porterhouse for 2 was cooked perfectly med rare and was very tender. Our friends has ordered other cuts of meats and also enjoyed their meals. We had leftovers and wouldn‚Äôt had ordered dessert but were provided 2 plates of assorted pastries with Happy Birthday written to each of our boys, compliments on the house. Such a nice touch. We would definitely be coming back.
Booked this place as a birthday meal for my sister while in New York City. I was impressed from the start, beautiful, clean and welcoming as soon as we got through the door. The atmospher was relaxing and a feeling of upper class without being snobbish. Lots of drinks on offer to chose from, menu was great with a mixture of sides to pick from. I ordered a peitie fillet mignon 10oz was asked how i would like it cooked. When it came out at was perfect! Melt in the mouth... We had appetizers on the house via the chief which was also great. (Mum could not eat this as had allergies), this was not an issue for them they went back and brought her something else. Great customer service. They made a real fuss over sisters birthday by bring a desert on the house for us all to share. They taken our photo and put it in a case so we could take away as a keep sake. Its definitely the little things that count. Wish we had a Club A Steak house in Wales. If i went back to NYC would definitely book this resturant again.Thanks to everyone.
Mine and partners first time in New York and I wanted to take him somewhere special for his birthday. I googled top restaurants in New York and this came up #4, so I booked a table in advance and put in the special request that it was his birthday not expecting much. We turned up and was greeted by a very warm and friendly welcome, and my partner was wished a happy birthday and given a menu saying happy birthday which was wonderful, more than I could of asked for! We were sat by the window on a very clean table with a rose and candlelight. The food we had was outstanding and bursting with flavour (my partner has oysters and I had the club a bacon for appetisers) my partner ordered veal and had it cooked to his liking which he loved every mouthful. Being a chef himself, he knew about cooking meats and addding seasonig to boost the flavour. I had the fillet mignon which I asked for well done, which I know drys out the meat but I can‚Äôt stomach seeing pink, and it made me so happy to receive a well done steak, no pink and was still bursting with flavour! We also had a photo taken together for his birthday which was printed out and was a great memento that we both cherish and appreciate so much! And my partner received a complimentary dessert platter with a candle to celebrate his birthday which was truly wonderful. This place was on a whole other level with their service and food. Will be going again when we visit New York again!
We are a UK couple who came to New York last week and ate here. It was our best dining experience in NY and the food and service is IMPECCABLE. Do not hesitate to book!The restaurant is clean, lovely and the service is flawless. We were waited on hand and food and felt so spoilt! Bread, water topped up frequently, some chit chat with the manager and complimentary starter and dessert which was out of this world. However, the steak was the real star of the show. We shared a porterhouse for 2 with some seasoned scrummy fries and sauces. The steak was to die for!!! We left feeling happy, full and spoilt with our only disappointment being that this place was so far away because if it was at home we would be there at every chance!Well done to the cooks, manager, waiters and everyone else involved!! And thank you for such a fabulous night.
My girlfriend and I checked through countless reviews, endless websites and various other sources before just making the decision to just book something. Given that for a number of travellers visiting NYC it is a huge thing and you might only get to do it once and choosing a steakhouse is equally a big decision! So if like us, this viewpoint resonates, I can assure you that based on our experience this place will over deliver in bucket loads. Fantastic server service, great setting and ambience, drinks never running dry, very clean and tidy, menu and process clearly explained and the food was out of this world. We ordered the Porterhouse for 2 + a number of sides and would easily go back here any day of the week.
This place gets an A+! Clean, friendly, and great environment. Food is fantastic and cooked just right. Can't wait to go back!
Our family spent the day in the city and had reservations for 5:30pm. After walking through central park it started to rain so we picked up the pace to get there early and out of the rain. Although they don't open until 5pm they let us in while they were still preparing the tables and we waited in the bar area for a few minutes while the owner came over and briefly chatted with us and the kids. We were offered a table upstairs with a beautiful view. Our waiter Diego was fantastic, as well as all the other servers who were very attentive, always making sure our glasses were full and table clean. The restaurant was well appointed and very romantic however still set up nicely to accommodate larger parties and families. The apps were fantastic and main courses were cooked to perfection. There are a lot of little touches done here that really separate them from the competition. For example, I ordered the dry aged rib eye which was perfection on a plate, my wife the filet, my kids had lamb chops, roasted chicken and a strip steak. We weren't sure what sauces to add on so our waiter brought out several for all of us to try, and they were all fantastic with no upcharge. We also did the 3 sides combo to share on the table and that was fantastic ( the truffle mac and cheese was the best I've had ). To top it off we were ready for coffee and deserts when our waiter took our coffee order and then came out with a full plate of desserts for the table on the house. Very nice touch ! The only 2 very minor gripes is I wish they had a children's menu or smaller portions for them because they could not finish their meals, it was just too much food for them even though they enjoyed every bite. And although the wine menu had some fantastic selections and is quite large if you are in the mood for Cabernet or Merlot, they should expand on the Zinfandel selection which only had a few bottles on it and is my preferred choice when dining out, however the ones they did have were excellent and familiar to me. Next time we visit we will definitely be making reservations here again. Highly recommended.
We visited Club A while on our first holiday to America and i can honestly say we won't forget our dining experience.Our waiter was very polite and knowledgeable, the restaurant itself is very clean and well set out with plenty of room between tables. The food was superb, reasonable in portion size and cooked to perfection!The only thing we would have changed about our meal was the fact that we ordered too many sides by mistake. at 3 sides for $24 this is more than enough for 2 people. We ordered 6 üòû.Over our 7 day stay in New York i would say our meal at Club A was by far the best dining experience we had.
I'm definitely surprised when I tried their food, the taste is heavenly awesome. The staff are also professional in handling their customers and well-mannered. The restaurant is clean and with good atmosphere. I will totally go back.
I‚Äôm from Texas, and we have great steak restaurants all over the place; however there is a reason why this is the #1 restaurant in NYC by Trip Advisor followers. It has been locally owned for 44 years, and the owner still comes around to your table! The food was top notch. My ribeye was one of the best tasting and best prepared, I‚Äôve ever had! (And I‚Äôve had a lot of them around the country. We will be visiting this place again!
Love this place! Have been going to Club A for many years and it always delivers. High quality and unpretentious. We go for special occasions as well as a local night out. Steaks are absolutely top-notch, great wine list and usually a special surprise on the house. Staff and owner are always incredibly gracious and helpful. Have enjoyed some wonderful jazz on weekends - a real treat. Club A has a LOT of history and many stories to be appreciated as can be seen from all the photos on the walls. A real NY experience even for locals. We look forward to many more visits. Bravo Club A!
This restaurant from the food to the service to the hospitality is 5 stars. My husband and I visited from California and were looking for a steakhouse to celebrate on our last night in the city. This place did not disappoint. Our server was so kind to us and treated us like long time friends. We made a joke about me not drinking because I‚Äôm pregnant when he came around for our cocktail order and he went out of his way to be so accommodating! They brought us this divine mushroom ravioli to start, and my husband that hates mushrooms devoured it! Our steaks were cooked perfectly and the Mac and cheese was delicious! They even sent over a dessert platter with a congratulations on the side. The owner, general manager and entire serving staff stopped by multiple times to chat and ask us how we were doing, and it made the experience that much more personal. If you‚Äôre looking for a locally owned non-restaurant chain steakhouse with excellent service and delicious food, this is the place! We can‚Äôt wait to come back to New York to visit.
What an amazing restaurant! Even though covid is still happening, Club A Steakhouse went above & beyond to help us forget (for a brief period) what‚Äôs going on in the world. For starters their Christmas decor is one of the best I‚Äôve seen. The real wood burning fireplace at the entrance is the perfect touch for this time of year. All of the tables are spaced 6 feet apart & they are abiding by all local regulations. We sat upstairs on the 2nd floor & it was such a wonderful experience. We had Bacon & Caesar salad for appetizers. Then we had a porterhouse for 2 cooked to a perfect medium rare. The warm & cordial servers seared it on the plate completing the amazing crust. We had their Mac n cheese & an order of garlic fries for our sides. They also decanted a wonderful Napa Valley Cabernet called The Prisoner. Bruno, the owner, is a throwback to what NYC restaurateurs used to be. He takes pride in his work, or as he calls it, his passion. It really shows! I assured him after Covid is gone, he will be standing & still doing great. Thank you Bruno & Club A for an amazing evening!
I feel compelled to describe my experience dining at Club A this week. Overall, we were very disappointed. I was expecting a high level of dining experience given the outstanding reviews on multiple platforms, however the juxtaposition with our meal leaves me wondering whether the restaurant was having an off night, or whether the mainly tourist patrons are easily swayed by a free dessert?We showed up about 10 minutes early for our booking, our coats were taken and we were informed the table wasn‚Äôt ready yet - fair enough, we‚Äôre early. However we were then left to awkwardly stand in the entrance way while perhaps half the tables downstairs sat set and ready, no offer to sit at the bar and have a drink. Oddly, a couple who walked in several minutes after us were then seated before us. We were then taken upstairs to be seated, however there was some miscommunication between staff so we waited a little longer upstairs. I noted that the entire upstairs area seemed to be tourists, half of whom were looking at their phones, one guy even having a phone conversation and another listening to music with headphones. Our table had a nice spot overlooking the street, however the glassware was dirty and the vase and windows were filthy. We asked if we could go back downstairs where there at least seemed to be a few local businessmen, but we were informed there was no spare tables. This was an outright lie we noted at the time and when we left an hour later, the restaurant was less than 40% full on a quiet night. I think the idea was to sequester the tourists, fair enough I suppose. At this point my partner was unimpressed, but I insisted on staying due to the fantastic reviews I had read online. The variety of bread was all stale and ranged from slightly stale to hard as a rock and inedible, there were also crackers and breadsticks in the basket. We enjoyed a nice Californian red, unfortunately the numerous crystal decanters decorating tables in the restaurant were not offered for use. The steak itself was decent. Not amazing, not bad, but decent. The cut of meat was average for the price (regarding marbling and butchery), not amazing but not terrible. Cooked mostly medium rare and seasoned nicely, though perhaps the outer 30% of the slices were well done. I‚Äôve had better steak elsewhere in NY, Europe and Australia. The best part of the meal was the sides - the mashed/pur√©e potato was excellent and the carrots were tasty. The charred broccoli was unfortunately dry and underwhelming. The service was average at best, I have no major complaints but there was no particular care. The staff upstairs also spent a bit of time playing on their phones and managed to throw most items down on the table, wine glasses overfilled from bottle etc. Interestingly, it seems like everyone receives a plate of complimentary desserts. This was dumped on our table before the mains were finished being cleared, and honestly looked unappealing so we did not try it. I appreciate the intent and that they‚Äôre hoping to make it a memorable and special dining experience, but I would prefer if they focused on the basics. If I wanted dessert I would order a single item off the menu, not an assortment of cakes and what I think were profiteroles. I deliberated between a 2 or 3 star rating, but the more I think about it the less appealing it was. We‚Äôre spending several weeks in NY and have had a range of upscale dining experiences, this was probably amongst the worst, particularly given the price. Looking at TA/google it seems like the fabulous reviews mostly come from other tourists and I honestly wonder what their standards are like.I note the the owner of this establishment replies to many reviews himself and seems to take feedback constructively which makes me believe he cares about his business and diners‚Äô experiences. My message is to please work on the basics - high quality steaks cooked consistently, and good service. 
I decided to give this local steakhouse in my neighborhood a try for the first time last night. The decor and atmosphere was very pleasant.My wife and I both shared the bacon appetizer, which was average at best, overcooked and a little on the cold side for my taste. We both ordered filet mignon medium rare with sides of baked potato, sauteed mushrooms, and sauteed carrots brown butter and honey. The steaks we're overcooked, one being at least medium and the other at least medium well. I'm not sure how they could come out different when ordered the same way, and they appeared to be identical size. We decided to keep them anyway hoping the quality of the meat would make up for them being overcooked. Unfortunately, the filet mignons were nowhere near the quality you would expect in an average American Steakhouse. The baked potato was so overcooked and so burned on the bottom that we could not cut through the bottom with a steak knife when we tried to share it. The mushrooms we're very good but neither one of us liked the carrots, they also seemed to be overcooked and dry. Club A has the smallest wine selection I've ever seen in a steakhouse so we choose two glasses of a California Cabernet called Decoy which turned out to be very good, sadly it turned out to be the best part of the meal so I ordered a second glass. The restaurant was surprisingly quiet for a Thursday at 7.30 pm but somehow our waiter completely lost interest in us after he took our order and never once came to check on how everything was, even though he walked past our table constantly. Another waiter brought a complimentary dessert dish with three small samples but never offered a dessert menu which we would have liked. Is it possible that they don't have a dessert menu? I tried to get our waiter's attention to get some coffee or espresso and some after dinner drinks, but he continued to ignore us and we eventually gave up and just asked for the check. Of course when he brought back the check he tried to be pleasant by asking us where we were from, I told him we're from around the corner and he told me he's from Montenegro and left. He should have asked how was the food and service, it would have been a more interesting conversation. On the way out I mentioned to our waiter that we would have liked to have had coffee and after dinner drinks but he never came near out table and he just looked at me and shrugged like he couldn't care less. I'm not complaining about the prices here, it is Manhattan and we eat out all the time, but this is not a cheap restaurant and the food and service world not have been acceptable had the bill been half what we paid. Being, literally two blocks from home it's a shame that it was such a disappointment as we would be regular visitors if it lived up to expectations.Club A gets an F.
To be honest, we hadn‚Äôt planned to dine at Club A. We left the apartment on E 57th St, intent on heading further uptown to a steakhouse recommended to us by friends. Thank heaven for the rain. We abandoned the plan to head uptown and instead, we circled the block to Club A. No reservations. 7:00 of an evening. No worries - we were seated within 5 minutes. And from that moment the experience improved steadily. The warm welcome was followed by the complimentary (and delicious) mushroom ravioli. What a tasty surprise that was!My partner chose the hangar steak while I opted for the blackened swordfish. Both of us were more than pleased by our choices. We had mashed potatoes and chargrilled broccoli as sides, which were so tasty!The service was attentive and professional without being overbearing or intrusive. The owner came to see how we were enjoying the food - a genuine and caring inquiry. Then came the surprise - a medley of three desserts - tiramisu, profiteroles and chocolate mousse cake - compliments of the House. We rarely eat desserts but these proved to be irresistible - and gratefully devoured!We live in a place where all beef is grass-fed (New Zealand). Being foodies, we are fussy about what food we eat. Club A Steakhouse more than met our standards, and then some. We heartily recommend visitors to NYC to visit this restaurant for a genuine New York Steak Experience. I regret that I have no photos to offer with this review. So, visitors, you will have to come see for yourself whether or not I write the truth!Thank you, Club A, for a superb meal and an enjoyable evening! 
We had tickets for the theater and went for an early dinner. The staff was great and we spent time with the owner who has been in the restaurant business for 49 years... I guess that‚Äôs why the restaurant was so terrific. Oh did I forget to mention that the food was delicious... we‚Äôre gluten free and there were plenty of options. Forget the big steak houses and try this locally owned masterpiece. 
Booked online for Club A Steakhouse and then confirmed my booking by email which was an easy process. We went on a Saturday evening and were served by the friendly and efficient Diego. We did not have wine but my husband and our friend had a local craft beer each and our birthday girl and I enjoyed the Leo Mojitos. Dinner was sublime. The boys had the bacon ü•ì to start and I had the calamari which were both tasty. Our mains - hubby and I shared a medium/rare porterhouse and our friends had the NY strip and mini fillet mignon. Sides of fries and mushrooms all cooked to perfection. The steaks ü•© were out of this world. Complimentary dessert was appreciated, the staff also took a lovely photo for us which they framed in a card for us. We had several members of staff just float by asking if we were having a nice evening which was appreciated. My recommendation - a lovely restaurant, red old school glamour, attentive staff, steaks to die for! A must visit. We loved it. Thank you Club A Steakhouse ‚ù§Ô∏è
Missed their steak that is huge and certainly meant for two person. Great ambience, and hearty huge set of food serviced. Guess it is popular with both the locals and tourists as it is quite packed. We are jet lagging when we are but no regrets! 
We just had Xmas eve dinner in this stunning restaurant after being recommended by friends as a great place to eat.Starters and early service were good but then went down hill.Steaks arrived without sauces, when challenged the staff eventually brought the sauces and the Beirnaise arrived cold. It was hard to get the staffs attention as they were busy with every NEW customer who arrived.Finally hot sauce arrived together with the Re-heated steak because it had been waiting.Asking for the bill took some time together with trying to pay it due to complete ignorance of the staff.Once bill paid we left the table with no recognition from any member of staff that we had been there at all.When we collected jackets the receptionist asked if everything was alright. I said "no this was the worst service I have had in years" she said, "never mind I am sure it will be fine next time" again no recognition anything was untoward.Having paid $270 I have had better service in a local chip shop.
We were fortunate enough to visit this restaurant during NYC restaurant week. We were offered 3 courses for $42 excluding tax and gratuity. This was a really good deal as the price of the steaks alone were around $50, so it is worth noting that this could be an expensive dinner without the deal - prob $100 a head. The food was fantastic, I hadn't had a steak this good since being in South Africa! The service was good also, not at all pretentious and the waiters seem to be locals. There were a few tourists as well as locals in the restaurant.
Good location in midtown. We had great steaks and sides with some very nice wine. Typical steakhouse deco with dark rooms and a lot of upholstery. It seemed to be very popular with tourists (probably due to the high ranking on TA!) but many locals were also there.
I was in town and was responsible for choosing a place for a business dinner with old and new colleagues. Looking for something special and not a chain. Found Club A on several food apps and was not disappointed. Family run and frequented by locals this was the venue for a great evening of food and relaxation. The restaurant has a charm of its own and definitely has a club-like feel to it. When one of my companions said his steak was over done it was replaced without question, extra servings of sides appeared and a large plate of cut fruit made its way along with a dessert sampler after dinner. I couldn't have been more pleased. 
It's not often that a local neighborhood steakhouse gets it right but the food, service and ambiance was very nice. Lots of choices and the waiter was very helpful in not letting us over order. We ate everything!Desserts were a nice touch with a variety served on a single platter.Quiet street and parking was available.
Fantastic food and really great service. Perfect for a special occasion! We had 2 times 6 oysters as a starter. Fresh and delicious! The New York strip steak (16oz) was extremely tasty! We also got complimentary mushroom pasta and cakes. Highly recommended!
We have ordered filet miqnon, mac and cheese, fresh fries and a couple of alcohol drinks. Everything was absolutely brilliant. The medium rare filet miqnon was slighly crunchy outside and super soft inside. Served with different sauces and all of them were so damn good. I have to point out the staff, who was so so friendly. I have never experienced such a good treatment about a customer in a restaurant before. Also, the interior is very cozy and nice. Now I know what it is like to be in the best reviewed steakhouse in New York.
We have had dinner tonight at this amazing steak house, and I cannot wait to wright a review. At fisrt, the place sends a message of being vibrant and cosy, with musiciens playing soft jazz and blues. As our experience started, service was precise and extremely attentive; the waiter was caring without excess but in a very simple and polite manner. Nothing different to expect from a restaurant one could say, however, experiences in NYC have not always showed the same. The quality of our dinner has been outstanding: we shared a starter - a crab cake- was extremely fresh and generous. The entree - a porterhouse for two- was perfectly served, at the right temperature, which is not easy when requesting beef to be bleu! Throughout our dinner, the presence and the eye of the owner - Mr Bruno Selimaj - never stopped being there, himself taking personal care of all guests well-being. This is our seventh trip to NYC, without having being able to travel here in the past two years because of COVID, but Club A is an address we will keep in our minds for our next visit: a restaurant you must experience!
Everything was perfect. Our salads were fresh and tasty. The filets were cooked perfectly as ordered. The Mac and cheese was cheesy, and the mashed potatoes were delicious. The servings were generous. The homeade tiramisu, and profiteroles are excellent. The servers were friendly, professional, and attentive. The owner is so kind, and makes sure everything is satisfactory. The atmosphere is warm and inviting. An added bonus on the night we were there, was his sweet, cute grandson who was helping out. This was a perfect place for our first time dining indoors since COVID. We felt totally safe and comfortable. All safety precautions are in place. I highly recommend Club A, you will not be disappointed..
In my 47 years of life, no matter how expensive the restaurants I've ever been to were, I had never before received the level of high quality service and attention I received from the staff and owner at Club A Steakhouse. It was truly out of the ordinary, even for high-end fine dining.The attention to detail they put into everything they do, from the moment the customer walks-into their establishment, explains why and how they've stayed in business for 43 years, in such a demanding city like NYC, where high expectations are the norm in the restaurant industry.The food was nothing less than exquisite and flawless. Each and every dish was cooked to perfection. The filet mignon didn't need any additional sauce or seasoning, to exceed the very high expectations of every taste bud in my mouth.The creamed spinach was undoubtedly, the absolute best companion for the steak, the best spinach dish I've ever had. The mac and cheese was also one of the most delicious, if not the most delicious, I've ever had. The tiramisu tasted so fresh and light, unlike any other of its kind. It was the perfect way to end an unforgettably amazing belated birthday dinner for my partner, which is not an easy person to please.I fell in love with this rare gem of NYC. Not only for its mouth watering, high quality and delicious food, but more importantly, for its unparalleled and unique way of treating their patrons.I will definitely be back to this elegant place with great atmosphere, food and staff, every time I'm in NYC, to experience again, one of the most pleasant dinner evenings I've ever had.I hope Mr. Bruno and his amazing team, continue to successfully provide, countless pleasant dining experiences to all of us, for many decades to come.

We came here as a larger seated party for my brother's birthday, and his wife could not have picked a better restaurant. The atmosphere was dark and romantic (especially for dating!), the live music really set the mood, and the food was absolutely delicious! We started with a few appetizers: oysters, bacon, calamari, a caesar salad. Everyone was wowed. The food was fresh and delectable. We then went onto mains, a couple of porterhouses and the rack of lamb. It was even better than the appetizers! The meat was cooked to perfection and very juicy. We did some sides: creamed spinach, mac and cheese, whipped mashed potatoes, and fries. I was a huge fan of the creamed spinach and wish I had a plate all to myself! The mac and cheese was delightful and the fries were super crispy. We had the birthday plate of dessert and it was all we needed to end the night. An amazing meal all around.I have to mention the staff as well. They catered to our every need, checked up on us constantly, and were very kind. I wish they staffed people like that everywhere, because they were great! I will definitely be visiting this place again and recommend you do as well!
This is my second time at Club A Steakhouse and it will not be my last!I love everything about the restaurant. As soon as you step in, you are welcomed by the warm atmosphere and the snazzy live music. We were welcomed by the hostess and although the place was full we were promptly accommodated. The food is absolutely scrumptious; the oysters are super fresh and the bacon's the best I've ever had. The steak was equally as delicious.I highly recommend this restaurant! Do yourself a favor and go there as it will undoubtedly become a favorite.
We have been here many times, but tonight was the best yet! Our server Nick was exceptional, had great suggestions for wine & was so friendly! As always the food & service was top of the line. This truly is the best steak dinner you can get in NYC. Seafood is always fresh & perfect. Will come back for every special occasion!
I ordered Caesar salad to split with friend. It was so wilted and mushy. Not fresh at all. Ordered the porterhouse steak. Was done to perfection but as I got to middle of steak it was rather tough. I'd give it a 3 out of 5. We were on first floor and it was so noisy you could not hear each other. Plus they had live music. All in all I will not be back nor would I recommend it to friends.
We started with the calamari and crab cakes. They both were a home run. Then we had a beet salad. So fresh. Then the filet and Porterhouse . Perfectly presented. Finished with tiramisu. To die for. I was sorry when it was time to leave....
Came here as part of my 30th Birthday trio and my partner booked this as it was #1 on Tripadvisor - it did not disappoint.... the service was fab and the food was even better. My steak came overdone as I think the waiter heard me wrong but they brought out a new one and we had a complementary desert and limoncello (ok top of the already complementary mushroom ravioli. The steak was superb - so fresh and delicious and the drinks filled continually. A real hidden gem in the centre of Manhattan. Old school vibe with great background music 
I visited this restaurant with my wife whilst visiting New York. The decor and atmosphere in this restaurant is very sophisticated and intimate.We ordered the Club a Royal platter which was a chilled lobster, shrimp and crab which was extremely fresh. To follow we both had a fillet steak, cooked medium rare. This steak was probably the best steak I have ever had. The cook on it was perfect!!We were given a complimentary trio of desserts which were also very nice and unexpected. Our waiter was very attentive and gave us a great recommendation on our wine choice, we could not fault the service. We would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves a good steak, good wine and great service, you won't be disappointed.
Celebrated my birthday in the city, and as of this writing, was rated #3 on TA. From walking in the front with the smell of a freshly seared Porterhouse wafting, a snappy 3 piece Jazz band playing (on a Thursday night!) with songs from the past and soft enough for us to be able to converse, an efficient and friendly bartender who took care of the whole restaurant, the evening was superb! Cocktails and wine, fresh breads, a wonderful Caesar salad and an enormous filet mignonette cooked to perfection, the evening was spectacular! The owner came by as he knew I was celebrating my birthday and brought out a complimentary array of desserts! Hope your mouth is watering! Do your research...believe in TA!
(4.7)We choose to dine here for our last night in New York. The service was friendly, the host suggested we dine upstairs, it was lovely. Fresh roses on every table and deep red decor made the restaurant feel intimate and romantic. We ordered the medium rare hanger steak, Mac and Cheese and Mashed Potatoes. The steak was seasoned and cooked perfectly. Quite tender for that cut, I wish we would have ordered one of the more expensive cuts. The Mac and cheese was silky, it had broiled cheese on the top which gave the dish more depth. The creamy mashed potatoes went well with the Au Poivre sauce. We were given complementary bread, mushroom ravioli(which was amazing) AND A DESERT PLATTER! I‚Äôve ate at a lot of nice restaurants but never have I been given an entire desert place for FREE. The only thing I would change is the time in between courses be longer and for the restaurant to be a little cooler in temperature. Great wine selection. I will definitely be recommending this to anyone visiting NYC. 
We visited this restaurant on New Year‚Äôs Eve, whilst on holiday from England. The whole experience, food, service, atmosphere was incredible. My wife and I had the prime NY strip, which was cooked to perfection and tasted out of this world. My three children had cheeseburgers and chips and were equally as happy with the quality. The staff went above and beyond throughout our visit and nothing was too much trouble for them. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anybody wanting a high quality dining experience in NYC. 10/10
Walked I off the street with my wife and twin 5 year old boys looking for good meat and mashed potatoes.Bruno met us and said you're in the right place and you're very welcome.The whole experience from start to finish was warm and welcoming in beautiful restaurant.Staff were attentive, service great and food was excellent.Ribeye steak on the bone, NY strip, mashed and baked potatoes were all excellent.Bruno who owns the restaurant since 1978 was extremely nice.We got beautiful mushroom ravioli and a beautiful medley of dessert complimentary for our first visit.We even got a family photo taken and put in a personalized card from Bruno.Class restaurant, class food, class staff and a classy owner.Thanks Bruno, until next time.
What a wonderful restaurant! Food was amazing and a kind, extremely attentive staff. Took my wife for her birthday! It was great and I would highly recommend. Bruno (owner) thanked us multiple times for selecting his restaurant for her special day. Even offered to let us wait inside while we waited for our driver. Not to mention the complimentary mushroom ravioli and a whole plate of deserts! 5 stars!
This place is really what it says it is. Amazing hospitality, something you will not encounter in any other restaurant not only in NY or North America, very rare in Europe. We were welcomed as family. We immediately felt that this in not a typical steakhouse or a restaurant which we normally see in NY so eat take your bill and off you go, next one. The owner takes every free moment of his time, which he spends on welcoming guests, to check how everyone is doing and if everything goes well at the tables. You really feel like you are at your family dinner. Food is delicious. One of the best steaks we had in our travels to North America. Very nice wine card with a wide range to choose your favorite one. And the staff will never allow that your glass is empty üòä. To the owner Bruno and the whole staff, thank you for having us on 23rd Dec, we felt very good there and whenever we come back to NY for sure we are going to revisit your restaurant.
Without a doubt one of the best steak restaurants we have visited, the food was only surpassed by the incredible Service. We shall return when we are next in NYC, thankyou to the whole team and keep up the great servicePaula and Eddie
Just had a few days in New York and as we visited here a few years ago, we wanted to dine here again. The first visit was just my wife and I, this time we went with my brother and his wife as we told them they will not have a steak anywhere better than Club A. The whole dining experience is absolutely first class, from being greeted and throughout the whole evening. The service is spot on, the food is perfection. If you want a memorable evening dining out, this is the only place to go. We couldn‚Äôt recommend this restaurant highly enough. In a word ‚ÄúPerfect ‚Äú
We read the reviews and bought the Groupon to use for our NYC visit. The decor is lovely here. The service is smooth and quiet. Not at all like the hustle and bustle of the big name steak places. We were offered our choice of wine bottles between cab Sauvignon and Pinot Grigio. The cab was quite good. Overall the food was good but the service and experience was the real star. They did a wonderful job with a surprise dessert for my girlfriend and that was the greatest thing of the whole meal. They also take a lovely photo of you and it's presented to you when you leave in a little folder.The Groupon is a great value if you eat moderately. For the big appetite you may need to add some more things.
I was looking for a steakhouse not far from home to take my partner for a special dinner to celebrate an achievement. Google spat out Club A. I expected good, but I somehow did not expect great‚Ä¶ Boy, was I wrong. Firstly, the food was super good and delicious! This was exactly what I was looking for.Secondly, the service was outstanding. They went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. The ma√Ætre-d learned that our dinner was special and on top of ‚Äúon the house‚Äù mushroom ravioli, 3 types of desserts and shots of limoncello, they also took a picture of us, which they then printed and gave us in a souvenir folder to remember the whole thing by.We will definitely return, and most likely regularly.P.S. Vaccination was required and they DID check it thoroughly.
We go to NYC once or twice a year and we always eat here when we visit. The steak here is terrific, a quality cut and prepared to order. While the prices are substantial, I can say that every large chain charges more for the same quantity and I think this restaurant serves better food. The atmosphere here is amazing. The upstairs front room gives a nice view out a large window or a good view of the whole room. The style is old school, old world, not in your face, just when you want them, properly pacing your meal. Bruno, the owner, usually greets every diner at every table. I have been here about a dozen times in the last five years, last trip was last Saturday night and it always lives up to my past great memories. There are a few other (very pleasant) surprises about this wonderful restaurant, but you will have to go yourself to see them.
Came to dinner for valentines night with my girlfriend and couldn‚Äôt be happier with the food and service. Whole restaurant was decorated and even gave my date a ballon. Nice touch and A+++ restaurant all the way. 
Amazing dinner Experience with great hospitality. We tried Club A Steakhouse for the first time during our New York City visit on New Year‚Äôs Eve, our experience by far has been great, from the live band, excellent food, great service , complimentary dessert and warm ambiance. The staff took a picture of us and handed over a picture card signed by the owner, who was around the whole night to make sure everyone is happy. Well done to the whole team, we will definitely come back to it.
Visited 3rd Oct with friends for 50th birthday.The whole experience was excellent from start to finish. You are greeted by an illuminated tree outside that invites you in to a pleasant bar with live jazz playing all night. We were greeted by the owner who was pleasant all evening.A credit to his establishment.We were seated upstairs in a booth to the front.Arguably the nicest area with a large window view framed by the lit tree.Food was excellent and well presented.I always like a mid course unexpected dish as well.Steak was delicious but did beat me at the end.We did have a selection of birthday deserts (presented to my friend) which we managed as a group and was a nice finishing touch along with a presented birthday photograph.The staff even escorted us to the corner and flagged us a taxi at the end of the night.Really pleased with my choice and would highly recommend 
Visited this steakhouse alone for dinner. I was 45 mins early and managed to get seated immediately. The waiter recommended some dishes which I had, crabcake to start, porterhouse steak for main. The steak comes on a hot plate and they transfer it onto your plate, the fillet to the steak was like butter to cut and tasted lovely. The other side was ok.The food was great maybe 4/5 however the service made my experience as 6/5! While waiting for my main, I received a complementary mushroom risotto from the chef and after the mains I got a complementary dessert with my bill. Even though I was stuffed I ate the whole tiramisu with something else on the side, don't know what it was but it was a cream filled pastry. So light and fluffy! I am not a fan of tiramisu usually but this one was perfect! Right amount of coffee and alcohol and not overpowering like they normally are.It was a pricey meal, my bill was $115 including a gin and tonic for $26!!! Considering all the other complementary dishes I received, the service and the taste of the food I was happy to pay. 
I came here from the UK for my Mrs' 30th, it was such a good decision. i spent a long time looking for the perfect restaurant for her and it didnt disappoint. the service was brilliant, the staff were really friendly from when we walked through the door and the attention to detail was something special. The food was AMAZING, the best steak ive ever had! my mrs thought the same thing!! the manager took a picture of us and signed it and wished her happy birthday with a cake and dessert, the whole evening was made so special for her. if i go new york again i would definately go here. i would also highly recommend here for anyone visiting New York 
This is rated so highly for a reason! We have just spent a whole evening here enjoying dinner and drinks... The restaurant itself is beautiful- decorated so as to create a very relaxed atmosphere. Staff are so professional - I don‚Äôt think I have ever experienced such attentiveness and their knowledge of the menu was excellent! They are all well turned out and work extremely hard for their customers. The food - outstanding! All of it! I have never had such a large steak, nor have I had a more succulent steak! Bar staff were very engaging, funny and we thoroughly enjoyed a very strong drink after our delicious meal. We weren‚Äôt rushed at all, in fact we were encouraged to stay. We felt very valued and I can not recommend this beautiful restaurant highly enoughatmosphere.

The steaks at Club A Steakhouse are pure and simply marvelous! I had the Prime Double Eagle Strip Bone-In 24oz, medium-rare. And I must say that I have never eaten a steak that was cooked to this level of perfection!You also get a small starter, and the dessert is on the house. There are ok but not more. The wine on glass was limited, and the recommended Cabernet Sauvignon was just a tiny bit above average.The service is friendly but a little slow.I would recommend this restaurant, just for the perfect steak!
My girlfriend enjoyed the butchers feast along side the farmers basket. Top class food and service, would recommend this to anyone that loves proper meat and that can eat a lot of food. Not expensive if you consider the amount of food you receive. Also the bartender at this place is pure class, the drinks he made was outstanding.
The ambiance and vibe is pure New York from the moment you enter. Live jazz band set up on the boundary of the bar and lower dining room. The restaurant has low ceilings and is done in a red decor with photos covering the walls. You know instantly you are in New York Suggest you start with the bar. bartender was friendly and the drinks were very good. We had a amazing dinner starting with the bacon which I highly recommend. We split a porterhouse for 2 and it was served on the sizzling plate. The meat is dry aged in house for 4 to 5 weeks and carry‚Äôs great flavor. Service was amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the evening and highly recommend this restaurant.
We came here on our honeymoon and the place was absolutely amazing. We had a lovely window seat that overlooked the street and the trees outside were all lit up beautifully so it had a very romantic feel to it. The steak was pure perfection, the best we've ever had anywhere else in the world. Lovely red wine and the service was impeccable. Our waiter arranged for a complimentary plate of desserts as it was also my birthday. We told the owner we'd found the restaurant on TripAdvisor and he gave us a free round of drinks on the house as well. Highly recommend!
We ate here because of the reviews and it was also our anniversary as well as 9/11 evening, The Rib Eye was awesome, my wifes Filet Mignon was tender as could be, the staff were johnny on it for service, what was most surprising was the owner, he made several stops to our table ot see if everything was ok and wish us a happy anniversary , who does that anymore, I will tell you who. someone who still cares about people, this guy was super friendly. We had the Mac & Cheese, this was to die for, the baked potatoe was huge, glad we shared one, the drinks, OMG you could taste the Vodka, it actual was a real drink, like the old days, when a bartender was a bartender. What can I say but pure class and who without doubt go back to this place again and again. Good thing we live in CA or we would be regulars
The staff were charming, polite, and immediately placed us at ease. It was a pure fluke that the restaurant happened to be the second most popular restaurant in NY on Trip Advisor, but no surprise, the only surprise is that it wasn't N√∫mero Uno! It doesn't pretend to be Haute Cuisine, or Cordon Bleu however if meat is your thing, then Club A is the place to be! The filet mignon and the Ribeye were unforgettable, and without doubt the finest steak we had ever tasted, and with over four decades of visiting amazing restaurants please take that as our unreserved endorsement for this wonderful restaurant. It had a delightful ambience, playing Motown melodies, delightful. The tables were slightly too close for an intimate conversation with your partner, but when it's this good you have to squeeze people in. Go soon, book early and enjoy the exemplary service, hospitality and steaks!
Dined here with my wife and daughter on our first night in NY and desperately wanted to score a 5 but my wife insisted it should be a 4 because my starter was not perfect (based on my feedback and not hers - that will teach me!). If I could have scored a 4.5 I would have! As you would expect 2 days after Christmas the venue was busy but well staffed. On arrival we checked our coats in and were seen to a nicely positioned table for three with ample space and no feeling of crowding - we were seated upstairs. Our waiter throughout was attentive, friendly and polite and it was great to see the owner `walking the floor' and engaging with guests throughout the evening (happy to talk to us about where he sources his beef from <Nebraska> and clearly very passionate about his business and feedback from his customers). My daughter and I had the 16oz Filet Mignon, butterfly seared at the waiter's suggestion, with Bernaise Sauce and three sides of Sauteed Asparagus, Yukon Potatoe Puree and Onion Rings and we both agreed the steaks were absolutely perfect [if you forgive the fact we had them served medium to well being our preference]; pefectly cooked, full of flavour, melt-in-the-mouth - the best we have had and the reason I chose this restaurant for our first meal even though we were eating at 2am UK time! My wife had the Lobster Ravioli, which she also thoroughly enjoyed commenting the lobster taste was prominent and not just token. We were treated to a medley of deserts on-the-house consisting of Carrot Cake, Profiteroles and Tiramisu, all very tasty and more so through the complimentry gesture! Now for my minor gripe that prevented me from scoring a 5 ... I had Crab Cakes for a starter and whilst there was more Crab Meat in them than you could shake a stick at, they had been pan fried with the coating tasting just that little bit burned; enough to add a taste that didn,t entirely spoil them but enough to offset the perfect and substantial filling of tasty pure crab meat (not filled out with other inexpensive ingredients). In hindsight, I should have said something to the waiter and I am sure they would have addressed but I was tired having been up for 20+ hour having arrived in NY that day. Anyway, we thoroughly enjoyed our meal and this was a minor gripe that otherwise would have been perfection, certainly the steak remains just that. On a final note, we had booked online at the restaurant's web site and were provided with a $15 discount voucher but we didn't use it on the basis that a.) We felt it would have been `cheap' to do so in such a quality restaurant and b.) the complimentary deserts were unexpected and well received. If you want the voucher book direct! With two pre-dinner drinks, a glass of Malbec, a large Amaretto and an Americano Coffe the bill came to $265 including an 18% gratuity; the equivalent of c. GBP165, which we consider good value for the overall experience and quality. All-in-all a great meal, perfect steak which we just can't get in the UK to the same standard - we would absolutely dine here gain.
We went to dinner on 12/7/13 at 8 pm. I had read the reviews prior to coming to NYC and was very excited to experience a wonderful steak dinner. We are from Chgo, so we know good steak We arrived a bit early and sat at the bar and ordered a drink. We loved the ambience of the bar area. Its small but so nice. The decorations for Christmas were beautiful as well. Got us in the spirit. About 10 mins later, the Hostess told us our table was ready.We were escorted upstairs and to the front by the windows. We love having views. So we were very happy to sit there. The trees outside were lit up so the block looked so pretty from our seat. My daughter said this street reminded her of Oak Street in Chgo. She was right. Both beautiful areas to visit when in NY or Chgo. The waiter was great. Again, very attentive but never bothersome. He got our bread right away. We each ordered a salad. I had the tomatoes with bacon and my daughter had the caesar. The salads were so delicious. I couldn't keep my daughters fork from nabbing my bacon pieces. She loves her bacon. They were big delicious pieces.Then we each ordered the Filet Mignon. That was pure heaven. We have never seen a filet this BIG in our lives from any good steak restaurant in Chgo. We ordered them medium and they came to us perfectly done. The owner came around at this point and asked us why we Chgo girls would come to his steak house when we come from the land of steak houses. We told him how we read all the wonderful reviews of his restaurant and wanted to try it. We were not disappointed. In fact, now that we are back in Chgo, we are disappointed because we know we can never match that type of filet here at any good steak restaurant. We ordered a two sides, mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts with bacon, of course!! Both very yummy.The owner came over frequently and is a very kind and very attentive to his patrons. He is very proud of his restaurant and he should be. This was the best ever steak restaurant we have ever been to.He is also one proud Grandpa. He showed us pictures of his beautiful granddaughter which we so enjoyed seeing. We will have to keep dreaming about the delicious steak we ate there. We shall be back!!!!
We had a wonderful dinner here celebrating my husband's retirement...from California. The staff couldn't have been more gracious or attentive, including Bruno, who brought his Grandchild over to meet us. From the elaborate carafe's to the wonderful wines, to the delicious dinner, it was all excellent. We especially appreciated the extra's we were offered, both side dishes and desserts. The steak was the best we have had ever, and that includes world travel dining.The atmosphere is pure New York City...cosy, beautiful and inviting. We will return!
I went to NY for period of 8 days.Purpose: wining and dining and of course spot of shopping. I was suggested many restaurants and one of them Club A Steakhouse. I was told its a fantastic experience and I should support co-patriots.Now I don't want you to think that I am bias, on the contrary, just because of that I am harsh critic.Food: I must admit I am not a big lover of the steak. Some 15 years ago I had a fantastic experience in S.A.and since then no Steak was coming close...until I came here. Boy, was that Steak melting in my mouth. I will apologize not to describe the rest of the dishes as they all were delicious, but my brain registered Steak only.Wine: wine list is well balanced and meets needs of all tastes and budgest.We left them to chose for us and it was spot on.Service; Really good and attentive service. Their timing was perfect! Don't you hate it when the conversation is interrupted? Well they knew when to step in and how long to stay with us .But, I must say the Cherry on the Top was Bruno, the owner of the restaurant. His elegant presence was felt on the floor, and you could see that he was making sure that all runs smoothly with his attentive eyeKeep up good work Bruno, and I sure hope to return soon!. 
I booked a table for 4 on a Monday evening to celebrate my wife‚Äôs birthday. Made to feel really welcome on arrival and given a well placed, central table table towards the rear of the lower ground floor. The staff were helpful and attentive throughout our visit. The steaks were cooked to perfection and the choice of sides was varied and well balanced. Drinks were reasonably priced and overall our visit lived up to the high expectations provided by the reviews. Enjoy...
My daughter and I pre booked a table for Friday evening (a pre- requisite) and the place is charming & full of positive character. Staff were very helpful and highly professional as would be expected from a 'top end' steak restaurant. The menu was well balanced, and of course we both enjoyed perfectly presented steaks. Everything was spot on; my only criticism being that that the crab cocktail - whilst very tasty had on recently been removed from the freezer and some pieces of crab meat were still frozen in the middle. But overall, this is a classy place, a great dining experience, but of course it comes at a price. I would recommend you give it a try ! 
Came with a Groupon as it had such good reviews. A watered down menu but we expected that and really good value as included a bottle of wine. The food was amazing, beautifully cooked steak and creamed potatoes, no greens or vegetables though and we weren‚Äôt offered any even as an extra which we‚Äôd have happily paid for. Beautiful decor and place, and waiting staff friendly enough BUT I‚Äôd read so many good reviews on the owner being really friendly etc, unfortunately not the case for us! He greeted us without even a smile, asked us for the voucher(fair enough) took us to our table and then not a word after even though we saw him smiling and and chatting with every other customer after us, we felt a bit awkward! It was my Birthday and didn‚Äôt feel we could say so. Again I will re enforce the food was beautiful, but we didn‚Äôt feel very welcome
My wife and I had a FANTASTIC experience at Club A Steakhouse &just can‚Äôt say enough nice things about this place!! It‚Äôs hard to pick restaurants in NYC due to so many options to and sometimes you just have to roll the dice. Wife found Circle A while searching for somewhere to celebrate our Anniversary and saw their Groupon couldn‚Äôt resist the great value of a Full Steak Dinner for Two with Appetizers, Entr√©e, Sides, Dessert, & Bottle of Wine.We visited on 7/16/21 for our 33rd Wedding Anniversary and from the minute we stepped in the door we knew we had made a great choice!! Over scheduled ourselves for last full day in NYC so we were running late, didn‚Äôt have time to stop & change into dress clothes, & arrived apologizing for being late & not dressed properly. Host that greeted us assured us that it was no problem, we didn‚Äôt need to change clothes, & made us feel welcome by telling us Circle A believes if the customer is comfortable then they are comfortable. It was a wonderful way to be greeted that set the tone for a great evening!! It‚Äôs a beautiful restaurant located near Central Park with an interior that has the feel of the kind of place Sinatra would have loved with all the hardwood, linen tablecloths, & ambience that makes one think of everything that makes NYC famous. We were seated upstairs and our server Nick promptly greeted us by taking our drink orders and sharing details about the menu. Unfortunately, we didn‚Äôt realize the Groupon menu is separate from regular menu so he had to change presentation mid-course but he did not change his service level or attitude because we were Grouponers. For anyone using the Groupon just mention it up front so you get the right menu which is a fixed offering though you do have the option to order off the regular menu; you just have to pay the difference.Nick was a fun server with a great sense of humor & stories all while being attentive to all the details needed for a restaurant to provide a great dining experience. He made sure our glasses never ran dry & was quick to bring the food courses. He is awesome so ask for Nick when you go‚Ä¶he will make sure you have a great time!Dinner started with our bottle of red wine included with the Groupon for people like us who are not Wine Connoisseurs we have no idea what the experts would think of it but we know what we like and really enjoyed our bottle. For our first course, wife chose Mixed Green Salad (Mesclun Mix, Strawberry, Pecan, & Pecorino) and I couldn‚Äôt resist Club A Bacon (Extra Thick, Applewood Smoked). As a married couple, we naturally sample off each other‚Äôs plates and we both thought the options were delicious (I personally thought the Bacon was best!!). We both got the 10 oz. Filet Mignon for Entr√©e and were beyond happy with quality of meat & that they were cooked to perfection. Wife chose Whipped Potato Puree & I chose the Creamed Spinach (Cream & Nutmeg) and both were wonderful choices. For dessert, Nick suggested we get one of each offering to sample both the Homemade Profiteroles & Homemade Tiramisu and we agreed. Imagine our surprise that what we actually got was an unexpected bonus that included a slice of New York Cheesecake!! Biggest surprise of all was when the owner Bruno Selimaj came to our table to personally congratulate us on our special day & thank us for choosing his restaurant for our celebration dinner. He then took our picture and gave us a card with the photo inside and signed it as a special memento of the night. He came back to talk & check on us a few more times and his son also stopped by with congratulations & a thank you for choosing Circle A.So happy we found Circle A since the Groupon offered the best dining value in NYC and gave us one of the most memorable dining experiences ever. Highly recommend it whether celebrating a special day or just want a great meal at a family-owned restaurant. Kudos to everyone at Circle A for making our special night something extra special!
The mixed green salad, filet mignon, Mac and cheese, house wines and tiramisu were all incredible! Service did not disappoint, was very attentive and overall zero issues which can be rare when going out with a large group!
When you see a place ranked as number 3 in New York you assume this means its a safe, if not excellent choice. This is not the case with this restaurant. My friend and I went as a last meal in New York before leaving the city and wanted an excellent meal to end a wonderful trip. This was not what we expected.Starting with the salad, listed as a mixed greens salad with no further description the salad came with roquefort cheese, while this is not the end of the world, it would have been nice to know that they put it on the salad so to know to ask to hold it.Next the meal. We both ordered the Filet Mignon, she medium well, I medium rare. Sides? Broccoli and fries. I asked the waiter what the process was for the saut√©ed broccoli. He said olive oil and garlic. Great. ((I should mention I have a severe nut allergy)The sides and steak arrive. Her steak, EXTREMELY overcooked, not slightly, very. The waiter was very gracious and offered to take hers back. Then my steak, medium rare is the recommended way to order a steak. Medium rare usually entails tender meat, pink to red with blood and tender to cut. My steak was dry, parts were well done other medium, no blood and difficult to cut. I hate to send things back and so didn't but needless to say worst prepared steak I've had in a long time.The sides. The fries were excellent! The broccoli came out with a dressing of pine nuts (remember the allergy?) I asked because I wanted to avoid this happening and the waiter never mentioned anything about pine nuts. So I had to send it back.Now we've sent the broccoli back, her steak back and so are eating the fries and waiting for her steak to arrive. The sides cool, my steak cools, the new broccoli cools and finally her steak arrives. This cut looking suspiciously unlike a filet mignon and once again over cooked, at this point though we've given up hope and suck it up and eat our steaks. Hers overcooked, mine overcooked and cold.To make it up to us they brought a complimentary dessert - our advice? Avoid the cheesecake and the tiramisu. So can you really call yourself a steakhouse when you can't prepare a steak? You tell me.
Classic style dark with red highlight lighting. Had the rib eye with hash browns. Very good! (Hash browns are made with pepper and green peppers- a little kick but very good.)I sat at the bar and had excellent service. Upstairs has the best seating - the piano room has a view with a lighted tree very nice. 
Went to Club A after reading the glowing reports from other people on Trip Advisor. While the room was intimate and the service excellent, the food was mediocre at best.A porterhouse that is ordered medium should come out exactly that way. Our steak was barely cooked in certain parts and was slathered in butter. I had my cardiologist's number with me as I ate. The hash browns had a bitter green pepper taste to them so I implore people to avoid them as well.To be fair, the service was excellent and the dessert on the house that everyone receives is a nice touch. Kudos for that.But as for a steakhouse--Club A was way more like a C+
Despite reading so many positive reviews of Club A, I was still skeptical - could the place really be that good? The answer is yes, it is. Celebrated the wife's birthday on December 28 with a night in New York that included dinner at Club A. Although we arrived ahead of our reservation time and the place was crowded, we were met with smiles and were seated within minutes. We had a variation of surf and turf, ordering the 16 ounce filet mignon and grilled sea bass. Although the kitchen was a little slow in preparing our order (I later received a personal apology from the owner, Mr. Selimaj), the food was outstanding. Both dishes cooked perfectly. I like mushrooms with my steak and a little bit of the side of mushroom sauce we ordered was all that cut of meat needed. The sea bass was accompanied by delicious julienne carrots and green beans. The Happy Birthday dessert dish of tiramisu, cream puffs and a slice of chocolate mousse disappeared almost as quickly as the entrees. I had a very nice conversation with the owner, who offered to buy us a nightcap as we were about to leave. If we didn't have tickets to a show, we would have spent some more time there. We look forward to our next trip to Manhattan, which will definitely include a return to Club A.
Went to NYC for an overnight with my husband for business and wanted to go someplace for a nice dinner. The reviews for Club A were so fantastic and I was able to get a reservation for 9:00pm. When we arrived it was VERY busy. We had two waiters at first and it took a little while to get a drink. After a few tables cleared the atmosphere was splendid. We each had appetizers, tuna tartar which came with a beautiful green salad and the tomato mozzarella salad, both were divine. My husband ordered a filet ( cooked black and blue) and I had crab cakes. We were pleasantly surprised by a lovely mushroom ravioli served between courses. That was crazy good. My husband's steak was absolutely cooked to perfection and melted in your mouth. My crab cakes were ALL crab, no fillers, beautiful, crispy and with a green salad. The owner Bruno, was bee bopping around every single table to ensure each customer's needs were being met. He came to our table and was very cordial and attentive. The waiter brought us a beautiful dessert plate after our dinner and Bruno offered us an after dinner drink. Can't even talk about the desserts without getting teary eyed. Cream puffs like I can't even describe, Tiramisu and a cheesecake that was the best I have ever had. It had a hint of cinnamon and was moist and creamy unlike some cheesecakes that tend to be a bit dry. Honestly, my husband and I just looked at each other and pinched ourselves. The place was the BOMB and we would go back in a heartbeat. Bruno was absolutely lovely and our servers were fantastic. One of the very best meals I've ever had and I'm a foodie. Thank you Bruno for your generous hospitality and thank you Trip Advisor for your wonderful website that I turn to first every time I ever have to go anywhere. Your service is invaluable. Merry Christmas everyone. !!
Bruno and his staff know how to please! My food was incredible and the servers were extremely attentive. The atmosphere is cozy and quaint! Make sure you ask to sit upstairs near the window - the view is nice with the green trees and white lights!
Whilst visiting NYC for my Mother's 60th we booked a table for 16 at Club A steakhouse - we originally attempted to book Gordon Ramsays BLT but they didn't seem at all interested in the special occasion and couldn't even guarantee we'd be sat together! We found Club A through Trip Advisor, it looked good, the menu looked great and the lady was so helpful when I rang up that we booked here instead.Upon arrival (we were an hour early) we had drinks in the bar area and were told our table was ready whenever we were. The owner came over and said hi and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful all evening. The food was amazing (nicest steak i've ever had) but the extra touches made the experience even better - complimentary appetisers and desserts (even a special made cheesecake for my Mother with Happy Birthday on)It was a very relaxed evening, we never felt rushed at all and once we'd finished the staff even helped us find someone nearby to carry on the celebrations. Some of the photos don't do the place justice - I thought it looked little and almost 'cosy' but it's actually quite large and furnished to a very hand standard (especially loved the lights outside on the trees and the wine decanters)They're aren't any negatives really but the only thing I would say is that if jazz isn't really you're think you may find the live music a bit overpowering at times(!)This place certainly isn't cheap but it was very much money well spent and i'll definitely visit again next time i'm in NYC.... We've previously ate at Tavern on the Green and this was head and shoulders above that experience!
This was our 3rd dinner reservation during our stay in NYC (Also ate at: Chez Josephine, Tao, Dovetail, E&E, Angelo's pizza, Carnegie Deli). The best customer service experience of the entire trip. Staff and the owner all thanked us multiple times for our patronage, the owner thanked us for making the trip from Canada and mentioned that we had made the booking through trip advisor. We split a crab cake to start- very meaty crab cake, not full of breading. A complimentary Lobster Ravioli was provided- Wow- you would not be disappointed to order the entre. My wife had Chilean Sea Bass and I had a Filet Mignon- both cooked as ordered- this place knows how to NOT overcook fish. Sides are available for sharing- we had: Mac and cheese with truffle, steamed broccoli (our lone healthy vegetable- can be sauted) and the German hashbrown. The Hashbrown steals the show- Potato, onion, green pepper, black pepper and a touch of celery seed- we had the leftovers for breakfast the next day- YUM. Dessert (Which we were going to skip) was a sampler of Carrot cake, tiramisu and another cream puff pastry- a free dessert- I passed the generosity on to the waitstaff- they deserved it!This was the only restaurant on the trip that I felt like I HAD to come back to the next time I go to NYC.There website is above average- lots of information including subway directions!
We ate here for our anniversary and it was very pleasant from the start. I requested to sit side by side and that's not usually accommodated in NYC!! We were given a lovely round table with plenty of room and a nice view of the street. The ambiance was very romantic and the servers were excellent. We used a Living Social deal for dinner and I have to say that it exceeded my expectations. The portions were large and the food was delicious. We shared a filet, a large portion of hanger steak (ever better than the filet taste wise), mac & cheese (superb) and creamed spinach (I added lemon). I had a mixed green salad to begin with and my boyfriend had the calamari...I'm allergic to eggs so I couldn't try it but my boyfriend said it was good, not great. Because I'm allergic to eggs, the server took it upon himself to substitute our desserts for something we could share. Three large scoops of delicious vanilla ice cream, a bowl of fresh whipped cream with a candle and a bowel of fresh strawberries, blueberries and raspberries, complete with "Happy Anniversary" written in chocolate on the serving plate. Then he brought us 2 glasses of champagne...complimentary. I was so surprised and pleased. It made our evening even more delightful. We will return. **Just up 58th street from the restaurant is a parking garage on the left right after the traffic light...if you take your ticket, they will validate and you can park for $12 for ten hours...A STEAL IN NYC!!! Make sure you turn left into the garage otherwise you'll be heading to Queens.
We found this Steakhouse since it was on the Restaurant week list. Simply amazing. We shared the caviar and green salad for appys and both had the 10 oz filet mignon. Very tender and came with several sauces if you wanted them. Had mac and cheese and mashed potatoes for sides. Desserts were yummy too! We ordered a bottle of red wine and it was decanted into a beautiful decanter. There were several styles of decanters throughout the restaurant. Bruno the owner comes aroud to greet patrons, which is a very nice touch. All-in-all a perfect evening! Nice decor!
We had a Living Social deal for this restaurant. The customer service was outstanding, from the moment we arrived until we left ‚Äì ever so happy. A real rose graced the linen covered table and a new candle was immediately lit as we sat down. We started with a light yet crisp bottle of pinot gringo. The bread was fresh, varied and included my favorite, dark bread with raisins. We ordered salads ‚Äì a difficult choice (as all the appetizers were so appealing but we were trying to control the calories somewhat). The salads, one of fresh greens (delicately seasoned with a delicious blue cheese dressing) and the classic caesar were as good as they get. My filet mignon and my husband‚Äôs hanger steak were cooked exactly as each of us ordered ‚Äì one rare and one medium rare. Both were tender, healthy portions that were seasoned to perfection. We talked to the waiter about how good the au poive sauce tasted. He quickly reappeared with a selection of other sauces for our dipping experience: hollandaise, b√©arnaise, mushroom and steak. The sides of creamed spinach and mashed potatoes were attractively served in little ramekins and tasted wonderful. This was a lovely evening that included outstanding service and food. Highly recommend.
Awesome night at Dos Caminos . Organic (skinny) Margarita and Guac was delicious ! Scotty was our waiter and he was THE BEST! So friendly, great conversation, had us smiling and keep the night lively. Churros were the bomb !
My husband and I really wanted to try Dos Caminos for a while. We came here pre- theater. We started our meal with the guac which was freshly made and absolutely amazing and drinks. I told our server Ela that my ‚Äòel camino‚Äô drink was too sweet, she offered to make me the ‚ÄòOrganic‚Äô instead, but I told her it‚Äôs okay and when I‚Äôm done with my first drink I‚Äôll grab her suggestion. The organic is one of the best margaritas ever. Good quality , great service !
I still can't believe this place is an excellent find. Which is why I was thrilled to be going a second time to see if the first time was a fluke, well it wasn't. I should point out this place is right in the middle of Times Square, a place I try to avoid like, well, trust me, I'm not a Times Square fan.Let me start with the Margarita, Outstanding! I had the organic margarita and it was one of the best I've had, period! We didn't have a reservation and had to wait maybe 10 - 15 minutes for a table. Service was prompt and pleasant. We had the skirt steak, and the short ribs done perfectly, tastefully seasoned, and again outstanding choices. Really delicious.
wow, where do I begin! I enjoyed my birthday and absolutely insisted in eating at one of my favorite restaurants. (I usually go to soho, amazing all around but decided to stop at 42nd st since I was already near by) The food was great, service was mediocre (server seemed bothered that I asked for extra crema and cheese yet didn‚Äôt receive it so I asked her again- I would tell you her name if I knew but we didn‚Äôt exchange much words besides our food and drink order which was fine) food came out fast but as we are eating our food an intoxicated couple was sat next to our table. One of the two people was hurling at the table leaving a barf stench that literally turned my stomach, and completely left me in disbelief that someone would actually attempt sitting at a restaurant with someone else in that nature. Unfortunately, management thought it was okay to give them a barf bag while at the table. Where is this okay? No apologies, no offer to move our seat for the inconvenience, nothing but accommodation to people who ruined everybody else‚Äôs experience around them. I would have loved to stay for dessert but the sound of a hurler while eating and smelling barf isn‚Äôt so pleasant. My partner and I expressed the smell was strong and we were uncomfortable continuing to dine and asked the server for a take home box and a check when she decided to pass by. She did notice our faces were scrunched up and asked if everything was okay- IT ABSOLUTELY WAS NOT. We were absolutely disgusted and headed else where for dessert. The way the intoxicated customers were handled with care was very compassionate by the manager, however the other surrounding customers that were sitting down eating like my partner and I were not so pleased with our treatment. It‚Äôs not only gross hearing people hurl while you eat but unsanitary to be sitting next to barf bags and management allowing it. There‚Äôs more ways he (the manager) could have went about it but instead they actually continued to sit people next to them! I get it, tables need to be sat- but that‚Äôs wrong and unsanitary! Rather than moving them to a table a little bit more secluded from others as the restaurant is far from small they left them in the open, where people had to pass by to get to the bar and downstairs dining area. To make things even more interesting, the manager actually decided it was a great time to take his lunch and sit right behind us. I would definitely stick to soho location: servers are great, great support staff and the managers actually put their all into every single guest and welcome you in. 
Ordered an 18 herb mole rib and a cocktail. The cocktail was fine, but expensive for the size. Unless all of the herbs the ribs had been marinaded in overnight were called "bland and flavourless", then all I can think is that it wasn't. I couldn't eat the food as it had little to no flavour - and I like a good Mexican.When the waiter asked if all was OK, I said it wasn't, but nothing was done about it and I still ended up paying for it. Not a good place to eat when in New York
The food was so delicious. My husband and I are gluten free and had multiple choices on the menu. Service was excellent. The restaurant was clean and beautiful.
Everything was good . Nice and clean , good service food was well done . was so impressed with my lunch this afternoon ! I tried the fish taco and it was so tasty . kamil Thank you .
So glad we gave this a try! The best cheese enchiladas I have ever had! Also recommend the cornbread which was amazing and my husband had the taco tour and loved all EIGHT tacos!! Our server Maria was great, was masked, and answered lots of our questions with patience! Very clean and fun environment. We sat in the lower level and it was a little hard making it up the stairs with our full bellies but it was definitely worth it. We also saw them working hard to help a large group of people make it out of the restaurant in time for a show. If you are staying in Times Square, especially at the W right next door you should really give this place a try.
Okay, I needed the bathroom to the extreme!! Old Navy/Gap, in repair. Levis none, mcdonalds have to buy, american eagle outfitters none, ran in here and thank goodness!‚ù§Ô∏è Sat to eat after that bs and got the chicken cobb salad ü•ó ‚ù§Ô∏è super good!! Big serving tho so share or be like be and eat the whole dang thing. Guacamole for solo was good too but my stomach wasn‚Äôt big enough alone. The employees are nice (especially letting me use the bathroom), but in general very nice. The fajitas (didn‚Äôt order it) but I smelled it - it wafted in like a passing dream, I had to ask the server what it was bc it smelled amazing. This will be my go to place from now on for sure. Good food, good people, clean bathroom in the chaos of time square lol Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏èü•óü•ë
Went to Dos Caminos with my wife and 3 boys on the night before Thanksgiving. On the plus side, the food was very good. Loved the guacamole and asada tacos. Unfortunately, I was a little grossed out by the floor. It was dirty looking concrete that looked as clean as the subway station next door. Our waiter was nice but overwhelmed. It took over 30 minutes to get our guacamole and had to ask for things multiple times during main course (ketchup and additional chips); which never came. The worst part was the bathroom; which was truly disgusting. At 6:30pm, the bathroom looked like it had not been cleaned in days - even my 7 year old was horrified. Next time, I would consider using the bathroom at the subway station down the block - as it is probably cleaner.
Great location, service was decent - food was just meh. Guacamole with trio of Salsas was decent, served in a large lava type bowl was interesting. Fish Tacos (New Pescado) were okay...the lower level was dark and gloomy, washrooms were not very clean, stay on the upper level and people watch.
was looking for a good mexican place. expected much better food. place was very ordinary. not clean. tables were sticky and so were the floors. service was ok. too noisy and clustered . serving size also too small for the price. didnt enjoy this at all.
Everything we had was quite good - the four of us had the chicken, shrimp, goat and Caesar salad, and everyone was well satisfied. Nice atmosphere, quiet (but we were there early for dinner). Only disagreeable part was having to go downstairs to the basement for the rest room. But they were clean, so that was ok. 
This is a very busy place, right on Times Square. We were not expecting much, just needed a place to eat. The grapefruit margarita was one of the best margaritas I have ever had, it was delicious. (And we live in Tucson!) Our food was also delicious, not typical Mexican food smothered with refried beans and cheese, very fresh and healthy, cooked perfectly. Waitress very pleasant. Decor modern and hip, very clean looking. Not cheap, but appropriately priced for Times Square. Portions were plenty large, we were full. Great people watching through big windows. We did not order the guacamole, but ladies next to us got it, the bowl was huge, it looked great. I wanted to eat what they couldn't finish, but my wife wouldn't let me take the bowl off their table when they left.
Interesting mexican food, but the 1st impression as far as the hygiene of the place is not outstanding...HUGE restaurant downstairs, with quite a nice atmosphere, again with efforts to be placed on a cleaner look
We had an excellent meal here- guacamole ($28), tacos (chicken and carnitas- $18 for 3). The tacos were excellent, beer was cold, everything at NY prices ($28 for a large guac). Great location allows people watching.
We experienced Don Caminos on our recent trip to New York. We were seated at a window bar seat. We found this to be fascinating as we enjoy people watching. The service was prompt with very polite and courteous staff. The food was excellent. Drinks are awesome as well. Pricing for a lunch time meal of soft tacos, burritos and a couple of drinks was reasonable. The restaurant is clean and comfortable. It can be a little noisy at times but we felt that this fitted with the atmosphere.
I had to wait a while to get the server's attention and to clean my space at the bar, and he didn't seem to know how to make the drink I requested, but the food ended up being quite good. I loved the Mexican street corn off the cob, but it was very, very greasy.
The food was okay, but I have definitely had better Mexican food. Also, their bathrooms were not clean, so I don't know how clean the kitchen is, despite their "A" rating.
I would not recommend anyone eat here. I have been to the Dos Caminos on Park Avenue, 3rd Avenue and Soho, and those are great restaurants. I expected the one in Times Square to have the same atmosphere, service and food. I was wrong. The service was awful, the food was slow to come out and was cold when it finally arrived. The atmosphere was not your typical Dos Caminos. It reminded me of a diner, not a nicer Mexican restaurant. I wish I went elsewhere. I would have been better off going to a fast food Mexican restaurant. At least the food would have been hot and served quickly. We made a reservation, but that made no difference. The hosts did not seem to care. They sat us in the front by the door and told me I should have requested the downstairs and it did not matter that I had a reservation. We had to wear our coats because we got a blast of cold air anytime someone came in. There is a downstairs dining area but I was told it was too full to seat us there, and then watched as five minutes later walk-ins with the same number of people in their party were seated downstairs. The bathrooms were not clean and were pretty disgusting. The only saving grace was the manager Greg. He did his best to rectify the situation but I do not know if I will ever go back to this location or this restaurant. I would not recommend it. Very disappointing.
We had a wonderful Mexican dinner after seeing the musical Wicked just around the corner. The food was excellent. Special mentions for the freshly made guacamole and locally made nachos - absolutely amazing! For main course we had different tacos, all of them great. As a surprise the waiter Winston brought us some see delicious churros for the dessert. Yummy! Shouldn't forget to mention the drinks either. We had some perfect margaritas and mojitos to go with the food. A shout out to Winston who was great at what he does! We really felt well taken care of.
This resteraunt is in the heart of Times Square so you think it would be crappy tourist food (lol) but no this is the real deal! I‚Äôve been here twice in the past few months and every dish is fresh and just plain great Mexican food. Local or tourist if you‚Äôre looking for a great and filling meal I‚Äôd definitely recommend! Even though it was busy our server Dee was ultra attentive and got everything just right :)
I love this spot!! Every time we come we are treated like royalty! It‚Äôs our new local. If you stop by you need to ask for Esteban or Karen. My two favorites!! 
We are local New Yorkers in before a Broadway show this was such a fun dinner we had with great food and a great waiter Darrien you should definitely visit!!!
I came here for lunch. Service is fast, friendly, and efficient. The lunch special is a LOT of food; I had guacamole and chips, tortilla soup, and two chicken tacos. Good quality of food. Prices are on par with other NYC restaurants...yes, it's more expensive than a local Mexican restaurant, but it's right in Times Square.
Yes, the prices here will be a little higher than your local Chili's as it's NYC and everything is more expensive. Chips and salsa trio are $4.00 but it's work it as the salsas are good. We had the chorizo fundido which was good as well. There are many good main courses on the menu - enchiladas, tacos, etc. The margaritas are excellent. Overall this is a good option close to Times Square. There is a huge downstairs bar and dining room. Best to ask to sit down there as it feels a little better than upstairs. Great service from Josh.
Overall - This is my second visit, for the first visit I sat with my family in the main dining room and it got 3 stars. This second visit was just the wife and I at the bar and it scored 5 stars. Even though it is family appropiate it is better for a more "fun adult" outing. Food & Drinks - As it is National Tequila day we "had" to ordered two shots of tequila (Avion), wife got a prickly pear margarita and I got a corona light. Pretty standard, beverages. Orders the guacamole, taco dou (pork and chicken) and empanadas de platano to share. All three were great the clear winner was definitely the empanadas de platano made with sweet platanos, not the green ones, stuffed with black beans and cheese. I was a little leary but after the first bite I made that surprised face :). Service - The bartendar Carlos was knowledgeable about all of the drinks, a true pro. He walked us through a little tasting and all of his recommendations were on point. First time drinking a Mezcal and I am going to look for the tequila he recommended at my local liquor store.Atmosphere - Times square in Mexico ... so semi authentic but flashy since it is in times square.
Come early to avoid the crowds. We got seated without reservations at 5pm, by 5:30 it was a wait.Great option if you are heading for a show. The Mexican food is good but modern. The presentation is nice but don't expect to be served like at your local fav Mexican place.Overall the service was good, We enjoyed the food - especially the guac. The people watching was spectacular.
***SORRY, A LITTLE LENGTHY BUT A MUST READ***What can I say,,, if you know anything about Mexican food you will not like this place. The European tourists here appear to enjoy it though. Lol. First things first. After a week of sampling different types of food we started missing and craving Mexican food. We could not find any local authentic food since everything is a hot dog stand being serviced by middle eastern folks who serve your food while they hold a cigarette in their mouths. Funny but disgusting!!We ventured to try Dos Caminos. We were greeted by the cook who happened to have walked to the main entrance. He said the restaurant would be closing in 40 minutes and we were just on time for last call. He told us he would gladly make anything for us in a super polite fashion. We waited for the hostess and a young girl walked up to us and told us they were closing already. Lol. It was 10:20 and the restaurant didn't close til 11pm. I told her the cook had said it was ok and we were on time. She looked over at him and he smiled. She grabbed a couple of menus, looked at my wife and I with attitude and proceeded to walk towards a table.(Violation #1). In the most awkward feeling we followed behind her and without any words exchanged from the hostess we sat at our table and waited for a waitress. Thank god our waitress had a great cheerful and positive personality!! She arrived and offered us margaritas and went over the menu. We ordered steak and carnitas tacos which came with a side of rice and black beans. The margaritas were awesome and delicious!! The tacos were ok and over priced!! $19 for 3 tacos. They were served on top of cold mini skillets. Violation #2. Both meats had way too much seasoning which made them taste extremely salty!! Too hungry to complain at this point and we were fearing the rude hostess if we said anything. Violation #3,,,, cold chips for $4. Most Mexican restaurants in California pride themselves in serving complimentary warm chips and salsa before the meal which is a major factor in the quality of attention and service amongst the top Mexican restaurants. Here, being that its Times Square and sort of a monopoly for this place, poor service and low quality is expected. Kinda sad and disappointed if you come from Mexican heritage. Oh well, I'll never be back here but for future tourists and customers beware. 
We met up with my cousin and her daughter who were visiting from Florida. We couldn‚Äôt have asked for better service! Our waiter Winston went above and beyond making sure we were satisfied. He was all smiles. The front desk hostess was also a delight. The food was tasty and fresh. Will definitely visit again! 
Great dinner in Times Square - loud and crowded, but that is expected in Times Square on a weekend in December. Reservations are a must. We had a reservation for 6 and the wait time without a reservation was 2 hours. We had Outstanding service from Winston. He was helpful, efficient, kind, and attentive. All of the food was yummy - definitely recommend starting with the guacamole. It is fresh and delicious. Kids menu was also a win (and only $10). We would definitely recommend this spot to families or staying in or around Times Square. Ask for Winston for fabulous service. 
Popped in for dinner. Service was wonderfulDee was attentive, efficient and friendly. The food was fresh and delicious. Highly recommend!
Some friends and I stopped here for dinner. Food was great, the service was even better. Brandon provided the best service we had all weekend from any restaurant in NYC. Get the guacamole, it‚Äôs fresh and tasty. Everything we ordered came out quickly, it was hot and tasted delicious. Even though they are in the middle of Times Square, I did not feel the prices were hiked up, they were on par with pricing from around the city for this size and type of restaurant. Will definitely go back when I am in the city again. 
Great spot for after show dinner. The food was fresh and yummy. Our server Darrien went above and beyond to make not only our meal unforgettable but our experience as well. Can't wait to go back.
Everything is always so amazing when I come! I‚Äôve been here twice already and it‚Äôs always so fresh and delicious! Food is always quick but so good! This time we had Kami and she was so sweet and attentive!
The place is in the middle of Times Square. Comfortable seating. Excellent Mexican-inspired food - fresh ingredients and totally delicious. We had the fish tacos. Our waiter was Dee, who was fast, fun, and excellent. We're going back again tonight!
Stopped in for dinner and was hoping for a nice relaxing time. This is not the place for that. We were seated right outside of a large area that was having a private party. We literally had to shout to place our order and clearly we couldn't have conversations at the table. The service was ok, the highlight was the fresh made guacamole. The chicken in my quesadilla was super dry. I'm sure there are better options in the area. 
Really fantastic food! Run, don't walk to get here! I loved everything from the fresh guacamole to the extensive cocktail/drink menu. Everyone in my group raved about how all the drinks seemed to have been made from fresh ingredients (lime juice, etc.) and not a packet mix. Really creative drinks as well. Everyone in our large group of at least ten raved about the food and the service was very attentive. Would definitely recommend!
My wife picked out this place for lunch so I had no idea what to expect but was blown away with the layers of flavor in each bite. All the ingredients were super fresh. We stared out with one of their signature margaritas. They don't serve free tortillas so we ordered a salsa trio with warm chips. For my meal I ordered Pescados fish tacos (grilled) that comes garnished with guacamole, shaved green cabbage, coriander lime mayo, pickled red onions, and cilantro. I highly recommend. 
Came here on a quieter night than usual and requested a table in the corner. This time the service was phenomenal. Our server Ela was great at recommending the tuna, so fresh and tasty! Drinks are strong too :)
I love this place‚Ä¶ the atmosphere is terrific and the whole experience is exhilarating‚Ä¶ waiters are great! Margaritas fantastic, salsa is spicy, guacamole is FRESH, and every entree super satisfying!!!
Close to Hamilton theater. Salads and margaritas were amazing. Server Dee was incredible. Will definitely visit again when in the theater district and Bryant Park area. 
Our server, Dee was awesome!!! He was attentive, made us laugh and served our drinks and food quickly. We would go back. In fact we stayed right next-door to the restaurant and so it was a wonderful option for us the whole time we were in New York.
Our server Dee was PHENOMENAL! Great energy, he got our order perfectly and without writing a single thing down! Dee was a whole Vibe- and we appreciate awesome service. Will definitely come back bc not only was the food on point- the service was even better! Thank u Dee for an awesome experience for our girls night out! Xoxo-A
I had the pleasure of being attended by Julio and Kevin at the Time Square location of Dos Caminos, and words will never be enough to express the exceptional service he provided. As a tourist who had not visited New York City in 10 years I walked in through the door and felt like home. Julio walked me through the whole drink and food menu. More than anything Julio made me feel at home in a crazy city that never stops. The service, the food, and the staff (Kevin and Julio) was beyond words, and honestly the BEST service I had in time square. Kevin helped me select a tequila that aligned with my tastebuds. Also it is important to mention their vast and cultural selection of Tequila they have and offer to guest. It was impressive, refreshing, and will make sure to only come back to the time square location to see Julio because his service was the best I have ever had just in new york but probably in all of the nation! Both Kevin and Julio where exceptional. Nevertheless, Shout out to Julio for being a gentleman, having a mind soul, and offering a whole experience! I recommend it 10/10! 
We‚Äôre not in midtown a whole lot, and it‚Äôs tough to find quality restaurants that I genuinely want to come back to, but the absolutely lovely Esmeralda took SUCH good care of us (she even leant me a tide pen when I spilled on myself) and the food/drinks were excellent! We‚Äôll absolutely be back anytime we see a show!
Dos Caminos hit the mark on all things important to me for a restaurant - delicious food, extensive menu, fair prices and most important wonderful service. Winston, our waiter was extremely attentive. He arrived at our table with a smile that never left throughout the whole serving process. He was knowledgeable about the menu and answered any questions. I highly recommend this restaurant.
Delicious food. I had the Mole Cheese Enchiladas. They also have delicious Guacamole. Darrien was a wonderful server, making the whole experience even more amazing!
My husband and I were seated in the downstairs area which was more spacious and comfortable than the street level, however they sat a couple right next to us when the whole restaurant was empty!!Anyway we ordered the chicken fajitas and drinks. The drinks were Served efficiently but the food took an extremely long time to arrive. We found the fajitas lacking flavour‚Ä¶ I asked for hot sauce and they brought a trio of salsas, which helped the food greatly. I don‚Äôt why they they didn‚Äôt offer salsa with meal from the beginning!
I went on Saturday night before Halloween, The food was boring (we had tacos) and the appetizers (chips and guac) were just okay. They had a DJ playing really loud music which made the whole experience untenable. If we had sat upstairs it would have just as bad. I know they dont care its Broadway and they will have someone else who just loved it. I did not.
The only good thing about this Mexican Restaurant is good location, right on Broadway and 47th. My family of 5 went to the restaurant and the whole experience was bad. The food did not taste good, the guacamole seemed to be watered down. We all have different items from the menu, and we all admitted the food was not great. And believe me you must be bad for my family to complain about Mexican food. The service was poor also, it took too long for the order to be taken and the food to come and they were not busy. We were not given option on sitting, we were just taken to the basement. The most disappointing thing is the price, a party of two adults and 13,12, 4-year-old, five of us spent about $200 for the poor-quality food. I will not recommend this restaurant.
We happened upon this place while roaming around Times Square. It was really busy but they had open seating in the downstairs lounge. It was a great atmosphere and very comfortable after a morning of sightseeing. We went back a couple of days later for dinner. I highly recommend the prickly pear margarita and the queso fundido. I was pleasantly surprised about how good the guacamole turned out to be. No one had any complaints about any of the food. We were visiting from Texas and Mexican food was not something we were looking for in New York City. We were quite pleased with the whole experience.
I want to give a standing ovation to Dos Caminos. Seriously, the service and food were outstanding. I kept looking for a name tag on our waiter so I could individually thank him here but they don't wear them (I should have asked but I didn't want to worry him).First, 2 of our 4 people are lactose-intolerant. Our waiter knew all the ingredients inside and out and could instantly tell us what part of every dish would have dairy or not. For one that did, he quickly went and asked the chef if it could be made diary-free and sure enough, we were in luck. In addition, they specifically say on a different thing on the menu, that they had a dairy-free sauce. They were able to add it to this dish, to sub out the dairy-filled sauce. To have a waiter that is so knowledgable and understanding is amazing. Also, there's this complimentary bowl of rice, beans and something else they bring to every table. It has dairy in it, which we were made aware of, so the lactose-intolerant people just ignored it, which wasn't a problem with all our other delicious food. Next thing we know, our waiter is bringing over another bowl of it that he had the kitchen make special for the other two so they could also have some. We hadn't said anything or even cared but that extra step almost made me cry.Secondly, all the food was outstanding. I like Mexican as much as the next person but it kinda all tastes the same to me after a while. I got fajitas and I'm not sure if I ever have ordered fajitas at any restaurant before. They were so freaking delicious that I wanted to climb into the whole wheat shells and be one with them. I know everyone else enjoyed their meals as well!Lastly, I feel like the pricing was right on par. While we don't tend to ever go near Times Square when we come out, our show had been nearby and my sister & brother-in-law said this was one of their favorites. You would think, being near Times Square, that prices would be outrageous but they were perfectly in-line.
We went here for dinner after seeing a show at the Longacre theater. It was close to our hotel and to Times Square. We weren't sure what to expect. The street level dining area looked unappealing. The host told us we could go downstairs to the main dining room which would be "quieter". It wasn't. It was adjacent to their bar area which was jumping. There were no shortage of tables, probably due to the lateness of the hour.We sat down and, while we were looking at the menu, a couple near us started having a very loud yelling match. Sensing our discomfort, the waiter moved us away from them. We got a new waiter who was not real swift. We questioned our decision to eat here.After we got our food, we were glad we stayed. We each got the "Dos Enchiladas". It came with beans and a very tasty rice dish. We also ordered the chips and salsa. To our surprise, it came with three types of salsa: habanero, roasted tomato and verde. Very nice. Considering the experience as a whole, I would recommend this restaurant. The food was worth it.
Loved eating here - the food was all delicious!! We ordered a heap of starters and shared them as a main meal! The chips and dips, especially the guacamole were outstanding! I could have eaten a whole bowl of just that!Prices are good, and the service was fantastic! Cocktails were perfect!Would highly recommend!!
Went as a family of four for good Mexican. They have a few locations but the Times Square location didn‚Äôt disappoint. Food and cocktails were good, service was solid. Started with the nachos which were a good size and tasty. We also got the salsa trio which we didn‚Äôt need but it was flavorful. Atmosphere was pretty good, especially the downstairs section of the restaurant. Entrees were good, quesadillas were very tasty and a good size portion. Fajitas were also pretty good but nothing special, just a good fajita. Tacos were tasty and not too much. Left me full but not stuffed. Margs and Paloma were both well balanced cocktails
Amazing nachos with guacamole to start with, then got the enchiladas and chimichanga for the table. I personally prefer the green salsa enchilada but all the rest was very good too. Great spot for Mexican cuisine, close to the theaters so perfect stop on the way to your show. 
Was going to a play at the Barrymore across the street so stopped in for a quick bite. Service was not very attentive but waitstaff was pleasant, and was a busy hopping place at this time of day. Great cheese enchiladas in a delicious red mole like sauce, along with delicious green rice and black beans. Not a big fan of the Landrys chain or chain restaurants in particular, but good food in a good atmosphere. 
We have reservations for this "Mexican" restaurant near Times Square. Despite this, it took us 15 minutes to be seated. And there were plenty of available tables that were ready. Not a good first impression! The guacamole should have been named "Mashed Avocados"...no cilantro, no seasoning. Just mashed green "stuff". My entree which was supposed to be cheese enchiladas, was loaded with chili powder...the most I have tasted anywhere in the world in this dish. This restaurant is expensive for Mexican food. Just keep on walking and find another restaurant.
It was Cinco de Mayo and my husband and I were in NYC, so a Mexican restaurant was a must! We stopped in during the middle of a small monsoon for lunch. The food was fantastic. We started with chips and salsa. We got a tray with three types of salsa- one was way too hot for us, but the mild green salsa was wonderful and the chips were warm. We ordered steak (carne asada) and chicken (pollo) tacos. Both were very good! Our server was very nice and good about checking on us often. Overall, a great experience!
I recommend the Green Tomatillo Salsa which comes with the Guacamole. We were seated by a woman who tried to seat our party of three at a 2 person table. After we demanded to be moved, she took us to a proper table. Two minutes later she tried to move us again, but when she saw the look on our faces, she let us stay. Nesha (at least that's what I think her name was) was our waiter. She tried to give a large Guacamole to us (an adult and two kids) when she hadn't even asked. She took it off the bill, but also added a corn she shouldn't of charged.
We were in town celebrating our five year anniversary with dinner and a show. Sicily did not disappoint. From the quaint atmosphere to the made-at-your table dessert, we had a top-notch dining experience. Service was excellent--attentive but not intrusive. The food was superb with perfect portion sizes; the bread is served in a petite cast iron pan and baked with just the right amount of herbs and butter. The made-at-the table tiramisu was the perfect way to end the meal and something not to miss. The coffee/Kahlua flavored syrup poured on crunchy Ladyfingers and topped with Marscapone whipped cream and chocolate bits was a culinary delight. We highly recommend!
What a great restaurant. Honestly, the BEST meal I have ever enten in NYC. My niece and my sister said they felt like they were back in Italy. We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch. We each had a different anti pasta salad and shared a Margherita pizza. My niece had the Finocchio Salad, my sister had Carciofi and I had Fritto Misto. The plating was a piece of art and the flavors were incredible. For desert we shared the Torta Settevelli & the Crispelle. They did not disappoint. The wait staff were very friendly and the owner came to our table and explained each entree. The restaurant itself was very nicely decorated and very clean. Great atmosphere. Their prices were very reasonable. We will definitely be back!
Went before a Broadway show- it was fantastic! First time here and everything we ate was delicious. We were part of the clean plate club. Roberto our server and all the support staff were friendly and professional 
Great for date night or bringing your parents, local spot hidden off of 8th Ave. Roberto is the best and I‚Äôll definitely come back. 
Went for pre-theater dinner and Sicily was wonderful. Italian without being the heavy, greasy, overly cheesy food you see sometimes in the theater district. Roberto our waiter provided excellent guidance and we were happy with our mix of salad, pizza and pasta. We had to make a show and service was quick. Would definitely come back!
Amazing!!!! Pasta is so fresh. Everything was absolutely wonderful.Highly recommend! Great atmosphere!!
Food was excellent, pasta and all ingredients very fresh. If possible, service was equally good and maybe even better. Roberto was incredibly ‚Äúavailable‚Äù without being over-bearing and was very helpful with the menu. Highly recommend!
Everything was delicious! Roberto did a great job - the specials were fresh and original. There were 9 of us and it was also fun!!
Everything about this place is amazing; the decor, the food and the service. The manager victoria made us feel well looked after and made for such a special evening on our trip. All of the staff were so lovely - the food was fresh and well presented. A MUST DO in nyc. 
We are staying in a hotel by times square, we were struggling to find food that isn‚Äôt burgers and fries. On a walk we stumbled across this restaurant, read the reviews and then seemed quite good. We walked in to be greeted by a lovely man, didn‚Äôt catch his name, and were told a bit about the restaurant and how the pasta etc is all made fresh. We were then seated and had a decently quick service and had an amazing crab pasta, my mum had a merlot and it was lovely! We couldn‚Äôt manage pudding as we were full up from our mains, and the complimentary bread they bring out to accompany your meal. All in all was a delightful meal and if we could we would go there all the time!
Wonderful food !! Fresh pasta and great salads ! Roberto was wonderful waiter Ask to sit in the back room with the skylights 
Drinks were great- espresso martinis and watermelon sugar (fresh watermelon). Pizza as an appetizer was great, eggplant dinner, eggplant pasta, lasagna, and chicken was delicious. Ambiance and decor was great, authentic feeling
Situated in restaurant road we went where the people were. Seeing a crowd speaks volumes that the food is great !!!First up we were served fresh baked bread. OMG amazing !!!!‚Äã‚Äãentree we had Meatballs . DAMN !!‚Äã‚Äãfor main I had the crab pasta and hubby had a pizza . Both were nice . Not great but nice .we rolled out of the place with no room for dessert ‚Äã‚ÄãTip : Turn up at 7-45pm and all the theatre people are leaving or have gone . You are welcome ‚Äã‚ÄãIn summary Fantastic friendly service ‚Äã‚ÄãBeautiful street . Birds chirping . Couldn‚Äôt here the hustle and bus of NY ‚Äã‚ÄãSpecial thanks to Claudia
The BEST food in NYC with the most welcoming and lovely service!! The whole experience was delightful and the food was impeccable, this was my first time in NYC and it is easily my favorite!
Ask for Roberto, he is excellent!! The food was delicious and the vibes were great. Whole staff is very friendly. Will definitely be coming back!
I wish I could comment on the food quality but 90 minutes after being seated we still hadn‚Äôt been served our meals. Even with a reservation we were totally ignored. The whole restaurant was in utter chaos - several diners (including my guests and I) left without receiving their meals. Rude staff, no a/c - do yourself a favor and skip this place.
I have always seen this place but never been able to come and have dinner. I must say it was my first time last night and the ambience was perfectüëå The place is beautiful with a vintage feel. The bartenders were very attentive and the drinks were on point. Me and my partner had rigatoni bolognaise and organic chicken with vegetables and a puree sauce( it was delicious)... so much on the menu sounded yummy. The meats especially looked delicious, sitting behind the chefs counter definitely made my water mouth. I will definitely will be back for more. Looking forward to trying A new Cotes Du Rhone that will be coming soon to there menu, complimented by the Sommelier. Cheersü•Ç üç∑
After waking up with an interesting craving for steak tartare, my sister and I started searching for an easy, no-frills place to go fulfill our craving. We quickly found Boucherie and walked right in to be seated immediately around 11am on a Sunday. The space was beautiful with tons of natural light (including a sky light), greenery and a lovely bar that lined almost the entire side of the restaurant. We were lucky enough to sit in Aleksa's section as he was incredibly attentive, helpful and friendly. Between two of us we split the beef tartare (which was outstanding), french onion soup and steak sandwich with pommes frites. I'll definitely be back whether I want a high-brow dinner to impress out of towners or relaxed brunch/lunch with friends.
The atmosphere is beautiful, the food was absolutely incredible, and the steak was to die for with this herb butter. Would recommend checking this place out!
Hey hey!! Happy hour is sign right outside. Universal language for welcome and come on in. Sadly weather was so humid and sitting outside was off the table. We were seated at their balcony area inside. The manager Milos was so nice and offered to change our table before I told the waiter there were dripping from their ventilation pipe. 100% professional and great service. The menu is huge comparing to the table. I was a bit overwhelmed and I felt they used 100% of available space on the paper even added one more page for their butcher's menu. You sure will find something you like. Starting with cocktails, price range is similar to 99% of all places and i rate it above average. As their wine menu, the list is long. I saw many wine picked from Napa valley and couple French wine. Appetizer is a bit much.Instead of my usual order, I wanted their foie gra and tartare for our appetizer. Foie gra served with toasted bread and preserved beet is prefect. Please do smell it before eating and you won't regret. Tartare looks awesome and prefect for that Instagram picture. Normally not a fan of raw meat thou. Free bread is a bit hard to eat for me but I think it might be the weather drying but my friend said it's toasted. who knows. Fun part is the entree. Dover sole is sooo delicious. i still remember the lemony taste in my mouth after a day. I would go back for more but I don't want to be in financial trouble of course. Well seasoned and proper herbs, it's a perfect dish to be envy by your dining partner. So much so, she had to switch for my plate of fish. Ending with a plate of cut of the week isn't that bad. Asked for medium rare and it's prefect to my wish. I love how they served with veggie underneath instead of fries. Topped with a few delicious shrimp, I was in heaven. Dessert: I usually skip this part. We had their creme brulee and pistachio ice cream with champagne. That is how you end an anniversary dinner. Creme brulee served with raspberry and pieces of strawberry isn't that sweet which I enjoy a lot. Pistachio with the nutty feel as you bite down is perfectly smooth and creamy.
Nice food and drinks. The food here ia tasty and clean but the portions are kimda small compared to other restaurants.
Good place to eat well on clean environment... Then come visit Australia in your winter. Bring your swimming costumes.
I ate paella few years back at some friends and I always wanted to try it again but a Spanish restaurant! My daughter and I decided we will go to Boucherie for dinner. There was a waiting line with about 8~9 people standing in a queue a head of us. It wasn't long before our name was called. The place was packed with people, and the music was a bit loud. But soon we were we adjusted to the atmosphere. The seating was tight but well organized. The ambiance was nice and pleasant. The place was spik clean. The waiters were prompt and helpful. The food was very good and the paella was magnificent although we were told that it takes about 30 minutes waiting for the paella, but it was well worth it. Price wise it was about right. Highly recommended in NYC. 
Great service, delicious food , and waiter Akin was excellent, restaurant is very clean, all employees are very friendly. I definitely recommend it .
It is a decent French food. The service is great too. If you order desert, they will clean up the bread crumbs. For lunch, most restaurants don't clean up the bread crumbs. Most importantly the foods are very delicious.
Upon entering the sweet resturaunt my friend and I were greated by Manu. His delightful charm and keen sense of food pairing recommended a great belini. Overall my experience was delightful, prompt service, clean and loving. Thank you Manu for creating a beautiful sunday brunch experience for usüíñ
Good vibes, fabulous location in west village. A local‚Äôs restaurant and for visitors in the know. Great food, lovely atmosphere. 
It was a busy, late December Sunday for brunch and despite being bustling, our party of four was able to be seated quickly. We got a table on the mezzanine with a great view of the beautiful space, well-done Christmas decorations, and attractive, local crowd. The food was excellent and the service was on point and efficient. You can‚Äôt beat a good, French brunch, and Boucherie delivers. Ask for Michael.
The bar at this restaurant is amazing. An amazing place for locals to relax and hang out with the bartender Michelle she made the night memorable by being so hospitable. I 100% recommended trying out this location. 
The local cuisine was fantastic and authentic, just how I loved it in Italy. The service was top-notch. Our experience was made wonderful by the employees and management. Without a doubt, we'll return!
Incredible experience! Highly recommend for an authentic NYC experience that locals love. Best French bistro in the city. Michelle, our bartender, was top notch. Get the tomahawk steak, you won‚Äôt regret it!
This restaurant is not liked by locals. The location is wonderful, but the food and service are not. I feel bad writing a negative review for any restaurant, since it is a very hard to survive business in NYC, BUT, this place is really too expensive and the food is not good. Skip it and try one of the Wonderful New York City Village Restaurants. I suggest the Beatrice Inn or Via Carota
Came in in the middle of a wonderful afternoon to enjoy a La Vie En Rose. The perfect summer drink. Our bartender was Ranko, who was very friendly and provided great insight into the local sights to checkout. Definitely would come back again to enjoy the happy hour specials.
Place is awesome, Ranko is an amazing mixologist and the drinks/food were fantastic. I would recommend to all visitors and locals. H-Town f**ks wit it.
One of my favorite locals. Beautiful atmosphere, attentive service, and great French food. Often come for date night with the hubby.
What a beautiful place to have a drink at the bar and people watch in the West Village! Nice ambience and beautiful decor - definitely reminded me of the big bistrots in France. They had such a great wine list and the bartender, Nenad, was friendly and attentive and helpful! Recommended for tourists and locals.
Local spot for good French food and time with friends! Great and friendly bartenders that are respectful. Love coming here with family too!
Wasn't too loud which is really important to me. Got the duck let and it was exactly what I wanted, super tasty! Great wine selection. Benal was super helpful and made sure it glasses were never empty üç∑ will definitely go back!
Fun busy and friendly service. A fast paced local haunt that does what it says on the tin. Breakfast favourites with lunch options. Good steak tatar and poached with smoked salmom and asparagus. Reasonably priced wines. Crepe suzzette and creme brulee good. The ambiance with its high ceilings and large windows make it an inviting place to start your evening after that lazy lunch
To me, this was an average dining experience at best. From the restaurant week menu, the mussels were fine, the steak was barely ok and the tarte was good. I must have gotten unlucky with my cut or how it was prepared as so many seem to sing praises about how good the streak there is, but to me it was no better than a piece of meat picked up from a local supermarket, heavily seasoned and thrown on the grill. The steak was the main disappointment of the night. The service was as expected. With two glasses of red, the check came up to $150, including tip.Some appear to praise the restaurant for great wine. While that might be true, the restaurant does not produce wine, it merely selects it and places a hefty price tag on it.
My partner and I thought we would try Boucherie as we are long time locals and thought a bistro would be nice. Went at about 1:30 and the restaurant had barely anyone. Sat outside and the style of the restaurant is a nice change for the village. A large Pastis vibe. Slow service and unfriendly when nobody is there is a stretch to understand. The food was very bland and oily. Once again took some time for the waiter to come over to even ask for the check. Boucherie is not inexpensive, 31-38 for our entrees. In the village where literally amazing restaurants that are amazing are less then two blocks away I would never go back and should have know when it was empty.Maybe the chef and staff are different for dinner service but that is no excuse.
Great brunch spot! Got mimosas and the french dip. Both were amazing! The french dip was very fresh 
This spot is simply fabulous French food hidden in a corner of Christopher.The ambiance is amazing and the vibe is chill and calm.I came on Sunday at Happy Hour and I had the cheese board and it was gorgeous-fresh white cheese with strawberries, walnuts and honey for 10.00 as well as the Rose which Susana garnished at the end with some Aperol.Susana and Danika make you feel right at home.I recommend highly and give it 5 stars‚≠êÔ∏è 
Late night meeting with some colleagues, we decided to grab some French here. There are a few of these restaurants, the West Village location has a great vibe and plenty of outdoor seating. The service is excellent. Got a nice Cote de Rh√¥ne for the table with water ‚Äúwith gas‚Äù and ordered pate de campagne and steak tartare and a nice salade d‚Äôartichaut. As expected, the food is fresh and robust. The wine complemented the food perfectly. The scene was fun, especially on a Friday night. Recommend to anyone who wants French food or just a great vibe with a drink or glass of wine.
Food was so fresh and the restaurant is very cozy, Gaby was very attentive and super sweet!! Ask for gabby when you come in!
We were served an exquisite Chenin blanc with aromatics that rippled across the tongue. I ordered a harvest salad with a medley of fresh lettuce, tomatoes, sumptuous walnuts and melt-in-your-mouth goat cheese. Service was exceptionally attentive, everyone had a 10/10 fun time!
The service was unparalleled - our food came out so quickly, the drinks were freshly made and the host and the waiter made sure our every need was met. Ask for jacob and sidy!
What an incredible experience, the ambiance is so soothing here and the food is all fresh. Our favorite dishes were the mushroom ravioli and the creme br√ªl√©e. The GM was also so kind hearted. Highly Recommended.
Went here for mine and my partner's anniversary. They were able to seat us early ahead of our reservation which was nice. The inside was spacious, inviting, and decorated beautifully. They had the French doors open in the front of the restaurant to let in a breeze since it was such a nice night out. The food came out quickly and it was very fresh! Great selection of foods and drinks. They have someone who comes around very frequently to refill waters and clear the table in between plates. Most importantly, our server Shania was so kind and attentive the whole evening. She helped us pick out a wine and told us her favorites on the menu. I have dietary restrictions and she made absolute sure that the food was going to be something that I enjoyed rather than tell me what I wanted to hear. She was truly the highlight of the experience. When dessert came she brought it out with a candle to celebrate our anniversary. It was such a simple but sweet touch. I was surprised when I found out she was newer to the restaurant!
We had brunch with a visiting cousin and aunt here. They had outdoor seating which was very nice. I felt I was in a bistro in Paris! Staff was very nice and a shout out to Sarah who took good care of my 81 year old aunt.I had the croque madam, which had great cheese and ham. We also had the Nicoise Salad (fresh tuna!), Brandende de Morie aux oeufs (salted cod with potatoes - very yummy) and eggs Benedict. I ordered the Foie grass as an appetizer and we were not disappointed. We will return and recommend this place to everyone!
Lovely place , nice outdoor setup Fell in love with the tomahawk ribeye for two it‚Äôs 50 oz!French onion soup, foi gras and scargots Are a must... and ofcourse coq au vin yum!Service was attentive For drinks their signature cocktail la vie en rose very chic garnish with fresh rose buds And their absinthe cocktail el diable :tequila, mezcal , absinthe and hibiscus it‚Äôs a must tryFor dessert classic creme br√ªl√©e and apple tart Tatin with vanilla ice cream The anbiance was great !
I came here with a friend and we hilariously decided to be healthy and get salads. We compromised by ordering a side of bacon. The bacon was absolutely delicious and a thick slice! I got a salad with anchovies vinaigrette and egg/croutons while my friend got a salad with apples, arugula and cranberries. Both salads tasted very fresh and simple yet delicious. We also got absinthe drinks which had the delicious taste of absinthe mixed with some other liquors and fruit. Our waitress Alexis was awesome!
I dine here in the spring and sat at an inside table right near the open windows. I was comfortably out of the sun, and the breezes were delightful. I had an odd-hour lunch (3:30pm)...service was efficient. The onion soup, burger, and frites were well-prepared, tasty, and hot. The pricing was typical for New York City. I had been out for a walk and passed by a number of restaurants on 7th Ave S, but this one looked inviting. And it was.
We have been to this restaurant before, and so while playing tourists in the W. Village we decided to come back because we wanted good hamburgers. This restaurant does not disappoint. I had, once again, the Pat LaFrieda burger, my grandaughter had the truffle burger. Both were juicy, tender, extremely flavorful. The fries freshly cooked crispy outside, soft inside. The decor of this cafe is so beautiful we took out time eating just to absorb the beauty of it all. The french soothing background music only added to the excellent eating experience.
The restaurant has an engaging presence from the street. Sadly, the food was edible, ordinary at best. We ordered 2 salads: Nicoise and Caesar, with a side of Brie. The quality of the greens on both salads did not appear to be very fresh and the dressing had little flavor. 
This place was wonderful. Reminded me of Paris. Our waiter was phenomenal and very attentive. The food tasted very fresh and delicious. Highly recommend!!!
Fantastic food. The whole environment of the place was so nice. Great service as well. Ibrahim did such a good job
Great food, great vibe, great location. Came here during restaurant week! Their menu was pretty amazing and the service was great. Drinks and food were amazing and our Server Akin made sure we were taken care of the whole night, even recommended some amazing drinks! Definitely a must! Oh and dessert, to die for üòç!
I love Boucherie and I will definitely come back for more dinners here. The ambiance and food here were on a whole other level.
The whole experience at Boucherie was great! Our server Shania was really sweet and helped us make the right choices. Food, dessert and wine were excellent. The casual chic style of Boucherie makes the experience relaxed and special at the same time.
We ate at Boucherie West Village last night, where the drinks, the food, the service, and the atmosphere were all a pleasure. The sauces, the bread, everything was delicious. The lighting and the holiday decorations gave the whole place a cozy vibe.It was an evening to remember, and we plan on returning many times in the future.
Not a great experience & would not recommend. Service from waiters was fantastic a credit to the restaurant as for the senior member; the general manager-poor, unprofessional & rude. Stood and talked to the table next to us the whole time, unprofessional language & content. Hostess not particularly welcoming. Food was average. Will not return
the whole staff made me and my friend feel so comfortable! we had the most wonderful time. the food was so yummy, the service was great and the atmosphere is always so chic and bustling in the best way.
I would give this place a 4.5 for brunch, but rounding it up to 5. Reservations were pretty open for a Sunday spot, but it definitely got crowded around 1-1:30, so getting a res is recommended. Food was great, and drinks are strong! I had the cheeseburger and my friend had the steak sandwich. But the fries that came with them were the stars! I would give 4 stars for just the food. The service brings my rating up. Manu, or server, patient and considerate. We had the whole upstairs area for a while, and basically had him as our dedicated server. He was patient while my friend and I caught up, and gave us plenty of time to decide what we wanted to eat and drink. Overall, great spot for brunch! 
Great place for an intimate rendezvous with friends! The lighting is just right and the music is a wonderful tempo. The food is a whole other level, a refuge for carnivores with taste. You will also LOVE being served by Antonio who made the experience something fun and memorable. Will be back for sure!
I strolled in with my best friend on a Saturday evening, and it was one of the best decisions I‚Äôve ever made. Our bartender, Mens, was wonderful! He was attentive and wore a smile on his face the whole time. The champagne was delicious, but the scallops were even better. This place is an absolute must. The food is delicious, the wine list is amazing, and the ambience is great too. 
The place to be in west village. Walked in on a freezing New York winter night, in the mood for a drink. Was warmly welcomed by the lovely hostess and was seated at the bar. A guy called Miljan took care of me - exceptional knowledge of the wines, spirits as well as the food. Him and the rest of the bar team were like a cocktail encyclopaedia. Provided laughs along with the rest of the team the whole evening. Ended up trying the foie Gras and muscles - f***ing amazing!!! Atmosphere sexy, seductive but down to earth and welcoming. An absolute joy and would recommend to all, whatever the occasion.
In a nutshell, I won't be back any time soon! Went for Sunday lunch yesterday with friends. It was a large group (13), split into two table. I've given 3 stars mainly because of the setting; nice and spacious, high ceilings, mezzanine level, attractive relaxing 'neutral' decor, nice non-intrusive, jazzy background music, but quiet ambience so easy to chat. Also, I believe the reception were accommodating to my friend who booked, but allowing us to be seated before all the party had arrived (which typically doesn't happen in NYC!). Having said that, the place wasn't busy so no reason for them not to seat us.From there it went downhill. The staff seemed willing but amateurish, which isn't what one wants or expects from a restaurant of that price point (high). There were daily specials on the board, e.g. Sunday was 'Choucroute'. It seemed that was always the case on Sundays, but our waiter didn't know what it was and had to get help. The wait for the food was phenomenally slow. We ordered about 1.50pm; it took an age even for some bread to be brought over (after ordering, even though it was cut and ready by the counter). One table had ordered starters, but ours had not. However, our mains were all brought at the same time; no one even asked us whether our table would like theirs first. (As I was invited I left the interaction to my friend, but had I been alone I would have requested it. Common sense). As a result, we got no food until close to 3pm. I ordered the Duck Leg Confit. ($32) It was well cooked, if a bit greasy (pan-fried rather than roasted maybe?) but whole dish extremely disappointing, being comprised of only 1 leg, then rest of the plate full of frisee lettuce, and 'Pommes Salardaises'. Hardly the soft potatoes I had expected, and no hint of the promised 'truffle'. More like pan-fried potato chips from a bag! All surrounded by an inexplicable thick brown, overly salty sauce. Terrible plate and terrible value.My friend ordered Oeufs au Plat and was also disappointed; two fried eggs and a couple of small pieces of sourdough toast, and for $20!The omelettes and pancakes looked better. But everything was overpriced. If I'd been paying I would definitely have asked for something off the bill.Maybe this place will improve with time - and if enough people send feedback. But for now there are plenty of better french-type restaurants out there so don't bother with this one!
Everything was just on point. This place never disappoints, escargots were pure goodness, scallops were cooked perfectly and to end the night with the tomahawk was perfect. Location: West VillageServer: Alkin ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
So glad we stumbled upon this darling place. It‚Äôs a perfect stop to grab a drink and soak in all the beautiful Christmas decorations! Wonderful staff:)
Stumbled upon this place by pure chance. Vibe was wonderful and our bartender, Mens, was spectacular. Would certainly recommend and look forward to coming back again!
Tamara was an amazing server! The Diable cocktail delicious! Very well balanced! The service was attentive and quick, will definitely return!
This restaurant was the only well rated french we got at last minute. And i can say it was really good! Nice back ground music (just as loud as for a lounge place, but i like it), inviting atmosphere, kind service.Food was consistently good! We had scargot for apettizer, which i am not a big fan, but this was perfectly seasoned! My husband had duck confit, which was superb but only one leg with salad is quite small portion for a man. I had steak frites, cooked perfectly and melting in mouth, with a well balanced poivre sauce. I also had a drink called "coccinella", kind of strawberry mimosa so good that i ordered a second one.If i lived in NYC this would be a regular place to go. Really enjoyed it! Very pleasant night!
Amazing food, wide wine selection, super service. The music and the restaurant perfectly balanced. . . 
Great ambience! The Green Hour specials are great along with the friendly staff. Here on Labor Day and they offer half off bottles of wine.
I went for lunch at Boucherie for business. The other 2 guests' dish looked good (steak fries and roasted salmon) but my warm Goat cheese salad was a big no. 2 tiny pieces of bread (not even toasted) covered with cold Goat cheese spread lost in a mountain of green salad, it had nothing to do with the traditional recipe, that is usually very rich (using a specific type of Goat cheese that is served warm). This one was very disappointing.
Amazing food, don‚Äôt miss the green hour special. George and Kevin behind the bar took amazing care of us!! 
We came for the Green Hour special at the bar and I highly recommend it. The food and drinks are incredible and a great value for the price. I would recommend the White Lady cocktail. George and Kevin were very kind and attentive. We‚Äôll definitely be back!
Fantastic French food just extremely delicious. Been here five times. Once to celebrate a special birthday that was so amazing The food is Fantastic the wine was excellent and the desert amazing!! It has such a French Feel to this restaurant you think that you are in France. We have gone also for Brunch and that was terrific, the food and coffee is really good We have been to their Green hour which is the same as happy hour three times. The bartenders are really nice and make really good drinks. Plus the prices are very affordable. Thburgers are delicious 
Had a wonderful time at Boucherie in the Village this afternoon. Came for Green Hour, apps were great, try the octopus, Old Fashion was delicious. CA is out of power, so happy to be in NYC! Big thanks to our bartender Kevin, his recommendations were spot on.
Had a great experience at Boucherie. Enjoyed their ‚Äúgreen hour‚Äù with drink and food specials. Friendly staff. Quiet, moody.
The West Village has hundreds of restaurants and most of them are very good. Boucherie is on the top of the List. The interior is designed like a true Paris Brasserie with tile walls, mirrors reflecting the days gone by, wood and tile flooring and charming tables surrounded by greenery. There is a sidewalk caf√©, bar and open-air skylights. It is truly as if you walked into a restaurant in Paris. The place is busy and is also one of three; Boucherie on Park and Petit Boucherie are sister eateries. Green hour is their way of saying Happy hour from 4-7, so make a date and join the crowds.The food is very good. It doesn‚Äôt matter when you go or what you order, you will not be disappointed. The omelets are delicious and over-sized, the French toast melts in your mouth and the beef, well the beouf is superb! The food is very French, so there is a nice uniqueness to dining here. The drinks are hearty and the Fromage is delectable. A nice glass of wine and a platter of cheese here can be more than enough on a summer night.The service was excellent and well appreciated. The servers are polite, they know their menu and are attentive, but not overbearing.Very much the place to be over and over again.
For $100 per person it is not a matter of ‚Äúexpecting‚Äù everything to be at the top of their game, it should be a matter of fact - not so on this first visit to Boucherie. Front desk, excellent, welcoming, ‚Äòassistant waitstaff, quite attentive, our waiter, poor at best. It was as if we were doing him a favor being there. After choosing a wine that they were out of, I asked for a minute to look back through the listings. Ten minutes later he reappeared - it was a Wednesday night, busy but not slammed from what I could see. Our wine would sit, nicely, in a chilled bucket for the rest of the evening, out of reach otherwise I would have poured it myself since the waiter nor the maitre d‚Äô seemed to notice our glasses were empty until I caught their eye to bring it to their attention. Eggplant/goat cheese green salad, excellent, sweetbreads, amazing, the duck confit, poor - dry, and the ‚Äúpotato chips‚Äù tasted, the two I ate, like wet sponges - can‚Äôt say exactly what a wet sponge tastes like but this would be it. Oh yes, the waiter did come back once to see if everything was alright. 
Our new spot! We love the "green hour" and how great the staff has been to us! The environment is also amazing and a spot to go when you want a cute time in New York cityüòáüòáüòá
This newish restaurant opened about seven months ago. I was really happy to have an early dinner to enjoy this location.Boucherie is a very large restaurant space. We sat inside and we were near by the outdoor seating space. After some exploring throughout the meal, the location is deceptively small. It can seat over 200 people which is not common for a lot of Greenwich Village locations.The overall d√©cor is very open plan and welcoming. I really like the different seating spaces within the larger area. Next time, I would also like to try the outdoor seating.We really were hungry and ready to try a few different items from this new location. The staff started us off with some complimentary bread with olives with a grape tomato and prosciutto.Since it was before 7pm, we were luckily there during happy hour. The wine list looked very interesting but we looked at some craft cocktails with happy hour pricing of $10 each. We ordered the Marguerite for $10 with happy hour pricing and La Douce Framboise for $15. The Marguerite is made with Barbancourt Rhum Blanc, Green Chartreuse, lime and mint with blueberries instead of raspberries because they were out of raspberries. La Douce Framboise is made with Barbancourt Rhum Blanc, Dolin Blanc, lemon, raspberries, and hibiscus bitter.For appetizers, we were going to try two appetizers. Our server told us that the portions were quite large so we would be able to share one comfortably. It was a good suggestion. We ordered the P√¢tes aux Fruits de Mer for $29. This item was very well flavored. I really liked the squid ink linguine. The seafood portion was very generous and delicious.For our entrees, we shared Confit de Canard Pommes Salardaises for $32 with confit duck leg, fris√©e and truffle potatoes. This duck was very succulent and delicious balance with the potatoes. I highly recommend it .We had a second round of cocktails to with Anti Douleur for $10 with happy hour pricing and Bouchierie Sazerac for $10 with happy hour pricing. The Anti Douleur is made with Rhum Clement CSOP, La Muse Verte, pineapple, coconut and orange. Bouchierie Sazerac is made with Ritterhouse Rye, Pierre Ferrand 1840, Vieux Pontlier, Peychaud‚Äôs Bitters, madagascar vanilla and lemon.Our second entr√©e was the C√¥te de B≈ìuf Pour Deux for $145. This dish comes with 40 oz tomahawk rib-eye, roasted bone marrow & bordelaise. Yes, it is 40 oz. The bone marrow was fantastic with this dish. I have never had bone marrow with a meal. It was extremely tasty. The price tag is high but it was really worth it.Finally, we had one dessert to share which was the Profiteroles $10 with puff pastry was flaky, cuddled by chocolate drizzle and vanilla ice cream.
We are Thailand lovers and we were looking for an authentic Thai restaurant in New York. It actually teleported us to the country. The dishes were incredible, and their presentation was delicate and very pretty.For starters, we chose lobster bun (full of flavor) and chicken dumpling (we haven't had such good ones in a while!). As main courses, Pad Thai and Pad See-Ew (simply delicious). As a dessert, it couldn't be other than the famous Mango Sticky Rice, one of our favorite dishes. The rice was hot, and the flavor...just perfect. We tried their cocktails too. Pi√±a Colada and Organic Thai Mojito. Although both were delicious, my winner was the Pi√±a Colada for its sweetness, flavour and presentation.The atmosphere is very cool and the restaurant decoration is so cute. Definitely, I found my favorite Thai in the city!
Great ambiance and very friendly service. The Pad Thai and the Organic Homemade Egg Tofu Soup were amazing. Highly recommended ordering the crispy duck with the Pad Thai. The mango sticky rice was also delicious
Bua Thai Ramen & Robata Grill is a culinary haven tucked away in the heart of the Upper East Side, and my experience was nothing short of extraordinary.The journey began with the Tuna Tartar, a symphony of flavors that set the stage for a dining adventure. The Organic Thai Mojito Mocktail, elegantly presented in a coconut, added a refreshing tropical twist to the evening.The Phuket Noodle with chicken breast was a comforting delight, and the Mango Sticky Rice showcased the perfect balance of sweetness. Sipping the Pina Colada from a whole pineapple was an experience in itself.The Chef's recommended Clay Pot Fried Rice was a flavor explosion, marrying pork belly, Chinese sausages, and blue crab seamlessly. The Taro Custard Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e was a sweet revelation, capping off the meal with finesse.Every dish was a visual and gastronomic delight, surpassing expectations. The ambiance reflected warmth and sophistication, creating an ideal setting for an unforgettable dining experience.Bua Thai Ramen & Robata Grill undeniably deserves its 5-star rating. It's a culinary gem that beckons repeat visits. If you're in the Upper East Side, treat yourself to the excellence of Bua Thai. Your taste buds will thank you.
This spot has the most aesthetic decor and really great service! For appetizers, I ordered the super crispy rice (my fave), and duck salad. The crispy rice was the best I've tried so far, perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The duck salad was very generous with the amount of duck pieces give and there was juicy pineapples in it! For main dishes, I ordered Phuket noodles w/crispy pork belly, thai ramen noodles, and a boiled egg and also the jumbo shrimp in Choo chee curry sauce, which came with a side of rice. The dish presentations were sooo pretty. This is such a great date spot too because they also have the prettiest drinks! We got the Melon & berry sato and the organic Thai mojito. Be sure to make a resy because they do get super busy during dinnertime. Cant wait to come back !!
Very nice Thai Restaurant in UES. The food was good and the interior is so pretty and cool!Location: It is located in UES. The restaurant has nice interior, it has a lot of flowers and the ambience is pretty cool! The bar is the one that catches my attention! Seatings inside are limited and outside is packed as well.Service: they were nice, I believe they are all Thai cause you can hear their accent which I think was so cool.Food: Some foods are good and some are meh! CRAB RANGOON: crispy outside and there are bits of crab inside. SRIRACHA SOFT-SHELL: this is my least favorite, cause it was not crispy, i dont even know if its fried. CALAMARI: af course this is good, the calamaris are well fried and seasoned. ORGANIC PORK BUN: this is another least favorite. The pork is not well cooked, the bun is swimming on a sauce that has blood from the pork. PORK PAD THAI: this is my favorite! The pad thai is very tasty, the pork was grilled and cut into pieces. The noodles was soft and well cooked. KAO MOO DANG: it was alright as well, the pork is well cooked and seasoned, the sticky rice was cooked perfect. THAI ICED TEA: af course its good but serving is small.Price rating: 7/10, it was not bad for the price. It‚Äôs just that some food are great and some are okay.I will definitely come back here when I‚Äôm craving for Thai food! Definitely get the PAD THAI!
Review Categories: Ambiance, Service, Drink Service, Value, FoodAmbiance (4/5)Bua Thai is a cozy restaurant in the UES. It is dimly lit, but the lighting created the perfect mood. The walls were adorned with old photographs. The seats were very close together, but points were not taken off for that because that is typical of the city. Towards the end of my meal, a couple was sat next to me and they arrived with a thick layer of cheap cologne (think spray can body sprays.) The scent did not compliment the flavors of my meal. Again, this was not the restaurant‚Äôs fault, it is just to demonstrate how close the seats are. With regards to the bathroom, the bathrooms were very clean. The copper sinks were a nice decorative touch. Service (4.8/5)I was greeted warmly by the hostess. Every staff member had a genuine smile on their face and looked like they enjoyed their work environment. After each course was finished, the next course came promptly.Drink Service (5/5)Water glasses were promptly filled before each glass was halfway finished. I never had to ask for more water. Other beverages came promptly after placing the order. Value (4/5)The portions were quite large for their prices, which was a pleasant surprise. Cocktails were strong and worth their price. Food (4.1/5)Rock shrimp Lychee (4.8/5)This was my favorite dish of the night. The shrimp were plump and tender with a perfect fried crunch. This reminded me of Cantonese honey walnut shrimp, but remove the walnuts, and add lychee. It was topped with crispy thin fried noodles which provided the perfect texture. The whole dish was laid on a bed of greens, purple potatoes, and cherry tomatoes. Chicken Satae (4/5)The chicken satae was presented beautifully with peanut sauce, a vinaigrette, toast, and greens. The chicken was seasoned well, but I did find it a tad overcooked. The sauces made up for it though and added the needed moisture. The peanut sauce provided the sweetness and the vinaigrette provided the acidity. All the flavors were completely balanced. Crispy Duck Bao (3.2/5)The duck itself was super tender and flavorful. It was cooked in a way that the fat rendered nicely so I didn‚Äôt have to bite into any chunks of fat. The skin was crispy and provided a nice crunch. Despite the duck being delicious on its own, the bao as a whole was quite dry. I feel as if it needed more sauce.Ba Mee Gyo Moo Dang and Blue Crab (4.7/5)The BBQ organic pork belly was so tender and flavorful. The blue crab went surprisingly well with the pork belly. They use real blue crab, but it was finely shredded as opposed to lump. The serving was huge and I had to wrap up my leftovers.Thai Ramen Noodle Soup - Green Curry and Crispy Pork Belly (4.8/5)This was my first time having Thai ramen and it was an awesome experience. The broth had the perfect amount of heat and a great flavor. The crispy pork belly was just slightly too salty on its own, but delicious in the soup. Overall a great dish. This portion was also huge. Mango Sticky Rice (3.9/5)The mango in this dessert was the perfect ripeness and sweetness and was balanced out by the sticky rice. Regarding texture, the sticky rice was a little too al dente for my liking, but the flavor was still good. Thai Iced Tea (5/5)It‚Äôs hard to go wrong with Thai iced tea. Chiangrai Lycheetini (3.2/5)Although this was a strong drink and it did it‚Äôs job, it was too sweet for me. The presentation in the copper martini glass was beautiful though. Maitai (3.5/5)Again, this drink was nice and strong, but but on the sweeter side. The fruits were fresh and ripe. Would I go here again?Yes! I‚Äôd definitely come back.
My wife and I decided to give this place a try when we were hanging out in the upper east side yesterday . We always wanted to try a Thai restaurant in the city and see how good they are comparing to the Thai restaurants in our neighborhood in Elmhurst queens.  Upon walking in we were greeted with a warm welcome and seated immediately. The waitress helping us asked us what alcoholic drinks we would like and she recommended pina colada because I had no idea what to get . My wife got the lychee mojito. The cocktails came relatives fast and they were so beautifully decorated that I couldn‚Äôt stop taking pictures of them! I was so excited to try the pina colada right away because it looked so good. Pina colada there is one of the BEST pina colada I ve ever tried in my life ! It was definitely as good if not better than the ones I ve tried in PR when I visited years ago. The pina colada doesn‚Äôt taste powdery like some do and has a really nice consistency and perfect ratio of alcohol in it . To top it off they made all the drinks visually satisfying as you can probably see in the photos. The lychee mojito was really good as well. They did an amazing job impressing me with the way they decorate their drinks !  Move on to the appetizers now. My wife got the organic pork belly buns and I couldn‚Äôt decide between rock shrimp lychee or live butter lettuce wrap. I eventually decided to go with the live butter lettuce wrap Because it sounded more interesting than rock shrimp . Also I ve never seen a dish like that in all the other Thai restaurants i ve had . When the food came I was a little skeptical about the lettuce wrap as it looks interesting but ok . But when I took the first bite my palate just went out of control because there were so much different flavors and they all blended really well that I had to take another bite and before you know it I finished all 4 salmon wraps! Love everything about the lettuce wraps from the interesting Way of eating it to the salmon which were seasoned really well to everything in the wrap that gave me the ‚ÄúWOW‚Äù in my mouth. My wife allowed me to try one of her pork belly buns and the it was amazing as well. The buns were soft and the pork belly was succulent and the sauce that was inside was super flavorful. The sauce really brought out the pork belly‚Äôs natural taste . We were really satisfied with the appetizers and were looking forward for our main courses. We ordered 2 more cocktails in between our main courses and appetizers because we already finished our first two cocktails.   For main course I had the Thai ramen bua noodle soup with jumble shrimps with wavy noodle . My wife had the basil based soup ramen with rice noodle. Start off with mine . They always amaze me with the way they plate/ decorate their food . It‚Äôs super visually pleasing . Making the food look yummy/ beautiful before the person tries it is 50% of the game in my opinion. The shrimps were biggg and tender. I could tell they really did a great job grilling them. The soup was super flavorful and beyond satisfying my palates. The noodle had a good consistency to them. I love bean sprouts in my noodle soup! It gave me that extra kick and texture in my mouth. I absolutely love the ramen here and I am already thinking about coming back in the near future! My wife loves her ramen noodle soup as well.  For dessert we got the mango sticky rice. It looked really good . The flavor was just right . However I was expecting the sticky rice to be a little softer. Other than that it was a perfect dessert! Love the design of the restaurant and that it has a nice front patio area where you can people watch while you are eating... highly recommended !! 
We were so impressed with everything we tried here! Thai iced tea and Thai iced tea lychee were both delicious and not too sweet. For appetizers we had the rock shrimp lychee and fried wontons which were so good! I really recommend the fried wontons, very crispy and flavorful and not oily or greasy at all. The rock shrimp was great too and plated so beautifully. For entrees we had the Sukhothai ramen and clay pot fried rice which were both so delicious! I had the ramen with organic gluten free rice noodles and crispy duck. The broth was creamy and tangy with a kick of spice and citrus and the duck was super tender and tasty! There were also homemade meatballs in the soup which were so flavorful. I thought the rice noodles suited the broth perfectly. The chef recommended claypot fried rice was absolutely spectacular! It was filled with beautiful variety of ingredients, my favorite being the blue crab and roasted pork belly which were both incredibly flavorful. The clay pot itself is huge so you definitely get what you pay for in terms of creativity as well as portion size!For dessert we had the tar custard br√ªl√©e. It was the perfect amount of sweet with a crunchy bruleed top and refreshing whipped cream on the top.Overall an amazing dinner experience!
My husband and I had dinner at Bua Thai Ramen & Robata Grill Sunday night and this is now our new favorite Thai Restaurant!The service, decor, food and presentation were amazing and more than exceeded our expectations. The staff is friendly, always smiling and checking to see if everything is satisfactory. The restaurant is beautiful and pleasing to look at while having dinner. The food was superb! I can‚Äôt say enough to describe how absolutely delicious everything we ordered was.We ordered a cocktail each. I had the Chiangria lycheetini and my husband had the Bangkok mule. Of course, I tasted my husband's drink also and loved it. As a matter of fact, I would love either drink right now. We had the Sriracha wings and fried calamari for appetizers. The calamari was crispy and delicious, just the way we love it. The sriracha wings were phenomenal and the spiral crispy noodles on top were the perfect addition. The apps were so delicious that we left the plates clean.For dinner, I had Pad Kaprow with organic roasted pork belly which I will definitely order again the next time we go. From the delicious sauce to the crispy veggies, to the absolutely delicious pork belly, I could not have made a better choice. My husband had the Pad Kee Mao with chicken breast and jumbo shrimp. The meat, the noodles, the sauce was amazing. My mouth is watering as I‚Äôm writing this.The Taro custard br√ªl√©e for dessert is an absolute must! The custard is served with whipped cream, a perfect combination!A lovely place, with beautiful decor, pleasant staff and incredibly delicious food. What more can you ask for? We will definitely be back soon. In the meantime, I will be looking at the pictures we took and dreaming of Bua Thai Ramen & Robata Grill. 
Thursday night, my honey and I decided to have date night at Bua. We started with a round of drinks, bartender had a strong hand which is always a plus. For appetizers, We ordered the ceviche and crispy rice spicy tuna. It's not your typical Spanish ceviche, the fish is raw (sashimi like) in a soy dressing topped with onion, tomato and cilantro. The fish and toppings were fresh and tasty. For dinner, my bf ordered Pad Krapow with crispy pork. The pork was amazing, marinated to perfection, a crunch so crunchy you can hear it break under your fork. I ordered Ba Mee Gyo Moo Dang & Crab which was Thai Spanish noodle with organic bbq roasted pork belly, blue crab meat, spinach and beansprout. Once again the pork belly was deliciously seasoned and cooked. The noodles were cooked well but they were clump together. I also will the dish had a little more crab but overall it was a good dish. For dessert, we ordered a taro crusted brulee, the custard was tasty but I felt the sugar was over caramelized. Ambiance was perfect for a date night with indoor and outdoor seating. The service was friendly and spot on. I would recommend checking out Bua when in the area.
Note: I received a media invite to Bua in exchange for a 100% honest, no pressure review. The invite entitled myself and a guest to 2 drinks, 2 appetizers, 2 main dishes (excluding sushi/sashimi items), and 1 dessert.Bottom line: Service was a bit spotty, but food was pretty spot on. I'd give this an overall 3.5.Bua is a pretty neat Thai/Ramen/Japanese spot in the UES (83/84 n 2nd). There's a decent amount of outside seating, as well as spots at a bar and further into the restaurant itself.As other reviewers have mentioned, the menu is...vast and extensive. From ramen and wok dishes, to sushi/sashimi and seafood house specialties, the menu reads a bit like the Jersey diners I grew up on - pages and options for days; had I not done a bit of yelping prior to my visit, an indecisive diner like myself could have been faced with a Sophie's choice situation...albeit far more delicious and exciting.My friend and I sat at the bar, being serviced by the lone bartender of the establishment. Service was a bit slower than I would have liked (particularly for a Tuesday night), but not necessarily intolerable. I was a little peeved that a party seated at the same time as us received both their apps and mains before we even got our apps, but perhaps it was different orders/foods, etc. Nonetheless, the wait ended up being worth it!For drinks, I asked the bartender if she could recommend a cocktail that wasn't too sweet and she recommended the Bangkok Mule (vodka, lime juice, ginger syrup, ginger ale, and singha beer). Refreshing, and indeed, not too sweet.For our appetizers, we settled on the Lobster Buns and the Super Crispy RiceLobster Buns - Lobster with organic spring mix, avocado, and spicy creamy sauce - two per order. This was pretty interesting and yummy! It was a lobster-salad mix (not unadulterated lobster meat like in a traditional lobster roll) with a generous amount of avocado in delicious bao-buns. Flavor was definitely there!Super Crispy Rice - Spicy. Lobster salad, spicy raw tuna, avocado and sweet soy sauce over crispy rice. This was definitely the winner of the apps! Loved the contrast of textures between the lobster/tuna/avocado and the firmer rice base! Delightful!For our mains, we got the Ba Mee Gyo Moo Dang & Crab and the Clay Pot Fried Rice.Ba Mee Gyo Moo Dang & Crab - Thai spinach noodle, organic BBQ roasted pork belly, blue crab meat, crispy wonton, spinach, beansprout with a bowl of soup on the side - wow, such an assortment of flavors! Plenty of pork belly and crab meat for sure, and I really liked the healthier spinach noodles to contrast the other rice dish we ordered. I can definitely understand why this is under the "Chef's Recommendations"!Clay Pot Fried Rice - Garlic butter fried rice with onion, cilantro, green onion, hard boiled runny yolk egg, Chinese sausage, organic roasted pork belly and blue crab - We have another winner!! I completely understand why this dish is highlighted on so many other reviews! We asked if we could get brown rice instead of white, which they easily handled, and oh wow was this dish delicious! And a yuuuuuge portion too! This dish also featured pork belly and crab meat, which is totally fine by me! We had plenty of leftover of this dish, which I absolutely gladly took home.For dessert, we opted for the Chilled Lychee in Butterfly Pea Syrup. This...was unfortunately a bit of a miss. It sounded interesting, and was refreshing, but it kind of just reminded me of canned peaches/pineapple in syrup. I guess that's part of the description, but I guess I had a bit higher hopes.Overall, Bua shows a lot of promise and there definitely are some knock-your-socks-off dishes. Service / attention could be a bit improved, but that shouldn't deter you from perusing Bua's bounty of dishes and treating yourself to some great food!
I highly recommend Bua Thai Ramen & Rubata Grill for a delicious meal with large portions, great service, and nice ambiance. The menu indicates which dishes are spicy, so you can choose your desired amount (I prefer not spicy). My favorite dish was the Pineapple Fried Rice which I had with Shrimp (you have a choice of protein - the shrimp was fresh and delicious). This was served beautifully in a pineapple! The rice had pieces of pineapple, cashews, raisins and was very tasty! Not spicy. There was enough rice to take home for a meal the next day. Also very good was the lobster buns appetizer. It came with 2 bao buns filled with lobster salad and sliced avocado. Yum! It had a spicy creamy sauce but it was just the right amount of spice for me. The Super Crispy Rice appetizer (lobster salad, spicy raw tuna, avocado, and sweet soy sauce over crispy rice) was a little too spicy for me. The crispy rice itself was delicious, I just prefer a little less spice. My dining partner, however, loved this dish so if you like spice, you‚Äôll love this! Another main dish I tried is Ba Mee Gyo Moo Dang and Blue Crab (Thai spinach noodle, organic BBQ roasted pork belly, blue crab meat, crispy wonton, spinach, beansprout, and boiled egg. Plus a bowl of soup on the side). I loved the crab and sprouts! Nice and light and not spicy. The Thai spinach noodles in this dish were very good too. To drink I had the lychee juice which was really good! For dessert I recommend the taro custard brulee - the brulee tastes nice and sweet. Beautifully presented and yummy. I also liked the chilled lychee in butterfly pea soup dessert. Really pretty chilled soup - clear blue liquid with ice floating in it and several lychees, pineapple chunks, and orange slices. Very light and summery. I was there on a beautiful August Saturday night and sat outside, which was really nice. The service was excellent. Prices reasonable. I highly recommend.
*Check out my foodie instagram @teaseats for more!*I went to Bua Thai last night and had a really nice meal. I chose to sit outside because it was super nice out, which was definitely a good choice to enjoy the weather and to people watch. I started with the Lychee Juice which I highly recommend -- it tasted super fresh and had three lychee fruits in it too! I'm not even the hugest fan of lychee but I loved this. For appetizers I went with the Super Crispy Rice (lobster salad, spicy raw tuna, avocado, and sweet soy sauce over crispy rice). I've been meaning to try crispy rice for a while and this did not disappoint! The spicy tuna was a bit too spicy for my dining partner, but it was just right for me. Would definitely recommend! Next, I got the Lobster Buns (lobster with organic spring mix, avocado, and spicy creamy sauce). The lobster was the same as what was on the crispy rice and wasn't spicy. I love bao buns, lobster, and avocado so I definitely enjoyed this! My favorite of the appetizers was the crispy rice but my dining partner preferred the buns, so you can't go wrong with either. Moving onto the mains, first I tried the Ba Mee Gyo Moo Dang and Blue Crab (Thai spinach noodle, organic BBQ roasted pork belly, blue crab meat, crispy wonton, spinach, beansprout, with a bowl of soup on the side). It also had a (medium boiled? Somewhere between soft and hard boiled) egg in it. The blue crab was by far the best part of this dish, and although I'm not a huge beansprout person it did go really well together. I've had better pork belly before, but it's not like this was horrible or anything. The spinach noodles and soup were nice too. In general I liked it, but you can probably find better dishes on the menu. The other entree I tried was the pineapple fried rice (fried egg, white onion, scallion, cashew nut, raisin, pineapple, and yellow curry) with jumbo shrimp as my protein. WOW! This was definitely a highlight and I'd highly recommend it, and this is coming from someone who doesn't usually like fried rice that much. It was even served in a pineapple, which made it even cooler! I loved the chunks of pineapple, the raisins, and the cashews especially and thought it was a wonderful combination of flavors. The portion sizes are HUGE! With two entrees for two people, we probably ended up taking half (or more) of each entree home. Finally, we finished with two desserts: the chilled lychee in butterfly pea syrup and the taro custard br√ªl√©e. The first dessert is good for lychee lovers and also had nice chunks of pineapple (my favorite part) and oranges in it, but the soup it was in didn't have much flavor. It was light and refreshing for a nice summer dessert though! As a taro lover I figured I would love the taro custard br√ªl√©e, and boy was I right. It also came with a skewer of oranges pineapple, and lychee as well as some whipped cream and a condensed milk drizzle. I loved every part of this dessert! I would highly recommend ordering it, especially if you love taro like I do. The service and ambiance were also good. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at Bua Thai and would recommend it if you're craving Thai food in the area.TL;DR:- Lychee Juice: HIGHLY recommend- Super Crispy Rice: highly recommend if you can handle some spice- Lobster Buns: recommend- Ba Mee Gyo Moo Dang: not bad, but you could probably find something better on the menu- Pineapple Fried Rice: HIGHLY recommend- Chilled Lychee in Butterfly Pea Syrup: not bad but not my favorite- Taro Custard Br√ªl√©e: HIGHLY recommend- Overall: would recommend
My fiance and I came here on a Friday night for date night (which we haven't had for the longest time) and this place was perfect! Great vibe, lovely decor, AMAZING food, and the staff was extremely friendly and welcoming :) Even though they were short-staffed, the staff treated everybody with warmth! This place has a great layout with outdoor seating (for those who prefer dining outside when the weather is nice), seats by the bar, and table/booths. And even better, this restaurant also has a 4-7pm happy hour with a buy one cocktail and get one free - if this does not make you want to check this place out, then I do not know what to say!Onwards to the food! =)My fiance and I each got one appetizer, one entree, one drink, and one dessert. I am a sucker for Thai Iced Tea so I got that as my drink, which was super refreshing and yummy! My fiance got a lychee-flavored Thai Iced Tea, which I thought was really unique because we both never seen or had lychee-flavored Thai Iced Tea before but my fiance really enjoyed it! (And he loved biting the lychees which soaked well with the Thai Iced Tea)In terms of appetizer, we got the Crispy Duck Buns and the Super Crispy Rice (which was lobster salad, avocado, spicy raw tuna, and sweet soy sauce over crispy rice). Of the two, I would say that the Super Crispy Rice was the better appetizer - everything from the avocado to the tuna to the lobster to the sauce to the crispy rice itself blended so well together! It got a little messy to eat it though because everything was on top of the crispy rice but we did not mind it because it tasted amazing and we enjoyed sucking our fingers to get all the flavors :) We are both fans of buns and duck which was why we got the Crispy Duck Buns but it came to us mildly warm. The duck was indeed crispy and yummy but I expected more sauce on the crispy duck - all the sauce was buried underneath the duck. But overall, still delicious!For our main entrees, we got the Ba Mee Gyo Moo Dang & Crab in addition to the Clay Pot Fried Rice. The Ba Mee Gyo Moo Dang & Crab has spinach noodles, roast pork, blue crab, spinach, and bean sprouts which was a great blend of flavors. Never had spinach noodles before but it was scrumptious and flowed well with all the other ingredients in the dish. But of the two, I would say the Clay Pot Fried Rice came out as the winner - the rice is garlic buttered with onion, cilantro and green onion and had two halved hard boiled runny yolk egg, Chinese sausages, organic roasted pork belly and a copious amount of blue crab meat. Love that they were super generous with the rice portion and who can resist all these yummy ingredients together in one dish? Definitely not us! :) For desserts, we got the Taro Custard Brulee and the Chilled Lychee in Butterfly Pea Syrup. The Taro Custard Brulee was one of the biggest reason why my fiance and I decided to check out this place for dinner - it was beautifully plated and we are both big fans of custard desserts. Also, we loved how this restaurant goes beyond what is traditional such as a creme brulee and mixed it with a traditional Asian root such as taro - if you haven't tried the dessert, you wouldn't think the two flavors would go well together, but it did and our expectations of the dessert were definitely met! The Chilled Lychee in Butterfly Pea Syrup was super refreshing and definitely a must on a hot summer day or as a palate cleanser. It was gorgeously plated with lychee in a blue/purple liquid with ice cubes and definitely needed after a heavy meal!From the minute we walked into this restaurant, our entire experience was extremely pleasant and delightful and we left with super full and happy bellies! Definitely a gem in the Upper East Side and my fiance and I will definitely visit again!!
First off, I just want to note that my meal was comped in exchange for an honest review. The restaurant did not tell me what to write, nor was I obligated to give them a 4 or 5 star review.I have to say that the restaurant was very clean and the staff was extremely nice and attentive. Not only to me, but towards everyone around me. Even I was skeptical at first that they would give us special treatment just to boost my review. I was really grateful that they filled my water multiple times throughout the meal without me having to flag them down. It was 100 degrees outside today, and these guys made sure I didn't die on their watch. The space is huge, and from what I can tell can fit over 50 people easily. The back of the restaurant looked like there was space for huge private parties but it wasn't lit up for me to tell in detail. We were allowed to order 2 appetizers, 2 Entrees, 2 drinks and 1 dessert. We ordered the fried calamari ($12), sriracha softshell crab ($15), Pad see ew (roasted chicken $16), Clay pot Fried Rice ($22), Taro Custard Brulee ($8), Thai Iced Tea ($4), and Lychee Juice ($4.50). Prices are as of July 20th, 2019. With tax, everything came out to $87.64 which again was comped. We did leave a generous tip though, we're not those types of people. Drinks are well portioned, much bigger than any other Thai restaurants we've been to. The Thai Ice tea was good but nothing special. The lychee juice had bits of lychee throughout the drink and was topped with 2 whole lychees on a toothpick. This was surprisingly refreshing and well worth the cost. Food wise, everything was presented really well and mostly paired with lemongrass garnish. Fried calamari was great and portion was huge, but again it wasn't anything out of the usual Thai fried calamari. The softshell crab was big, we're not talking about those weeny spider roll crabs. There were so much meat in every bite. I just wasn't a huge fan of the sriracha sauce that it comes in. The real star of the meal was the clay pot fried rice. This dish has blue crab meat, roasted pork belly, running yolk egg, and garlic fried rice all in one clay pot. It was really a treat, and well worth the $22 that it's priced at. We couldn't finish this and ended up packing the rest to go. The dessert sounded good on the menu - Taro Crusted Creme Brulee. This however was the biggest disappointment of the meal. It wasn't anything we imagined it to be. It was very starchy, very similar to the actual taro form. I guess that means it's very natural and organic but I'm not really about that life. Give me something soft, smooth, sweet and unhealthy as a dessert. This was honestly the only thing negative I came out of the restaurant with and that's just my wife and I's opinion and you might actually like it.And one last thing. My first thought was that this restaurant is probably not even Thai operated because of the "Ramen" thrown in the name. I overheard the kitchen people talking in Thai, so it looks like there's at least Thai cooks in the back. Take that for what it's worth. Definitely worth a visit, and you'll leave full and happy for sure. Unfortunately, this restaurant is not close to our home and we'll likely only come back if we're in the neighborhood.
We had a lovely time at BUA! Few things I want to highlight at this beautiful restaurant:‚Ä¢ Foodie and Instagram-friendly: delicious dishes with fantastic presentations. The drinks were made - literally - on natural fruits like a giant coco or pineapple, with flowers and other fun stuff! I‚Äôm adding pictures below. ‚Ä¢ SUPER fast! We got a reservation and got seated in seconds. They were always attentive to pouring more water, bringing the next dish, etc.‚Ä¢ Food: we got mainly seafood. I also loved the presentation, and the portions were delicious - we got full! For dessert, I also want to highlight the location. Whether you‚Äôre visiting or based in Manhattan, this is a great street to have dinner at BUA and then do bar hopping around the block. We went as two friends and the atmosphere was great will bring more the next time!
This is a nice place to go for lunch or dinner if you're around the Upper East Side. It's only about a 10-15 minute walk from the MET. The restaurant has a nice interior with a relaxing ambience. Noise level is low, so it's the ideal place for families, friends, and even a date! You'll be able to have a conversation and hear each other without having to yell. The menu is very extensive and can be overwhelming, but I'll highlight the dishes that we ordered. Chiangrai Lycheetini: a pretty strong drink with a nice lychee flavor. I'm not a fan of sweets, so I thought that it was very sweet. This will be a great drink for you if you like sweet drinks.Strawberry Satho: a colorful, refreshing slushy whose alcohol is masked by the strawberry flavor. Pok Pok Avocado and Mango Salad: cold, bright salad made from ripen mangoes and avocados. It has a slight acidic and citrus-y flavor from the lime. It's a great starter.Sriracha Wings: sweet, crispy wings with a very very slight heat. The outside skin is crispy and the meat inside if juicy. This is also a good starter.Clay Pot Fried Rice: the pork is salty, so ask for a slice of lime to add some lightness to the rice. The blue crab adds a nice element of seafood-ness the heaviness of dish. The fried rice is very flavorful with some dices of onion. Make sure you mix the rice!Ba Mee Gyo Moo Dang: This was my favorite dish! Thai spinach noodles with pork, crab meat, and a side of broth. The noodles are wavy, slighty al dente, and is similar to ramen. The broth was soo delicious! It helped mitigate the sweetness of the dish by adding an element of mellow smokiness. I definitely recommend this order!Mango with Sticky Rice: suprisingly, this was the least sweetest dish. The coconut milk was on the saltier side, which helped cut the mango's natural sweetness. The ratio of mango to sticky rice was off, because we were left with a lot of sticky rice. Additionally, the sticky rice was a little bit tougher than what I'm used to. It's a good dessert, but I would suggest that they make their rice stickier and softer. Overall, the food is decent. Thai food is one of my favorite cuisines, so I was expecting the dishes to have more flavor and spiciness, but it was just mild. It also was slightly too sweet, while some dishes were a tad bit salty. If you enjoy food that is either sweet or salty, then you'll definitely like this spot. I recommend ordering family-style. Choose a few dishes and share them with your party. Moreover, the service was amazing, The staff was very inviting and attentive. If you're around the area, check out Bua.
It may look like your average neighborhood Thai restaurant, but Bua Thai is anything but! I wandered in with my cousin and was immediately greeted by the friendly staff and incredible aroma of Thai ingredients. We arrived at 7:30pm and didn‚Äôt have any issue finding a table.The atmosphere at Bua surpassed my expectations. The restaurant had great lighting, tables were nicely spaced from each other, soft music was playing in the background, and great nature inspired decor. It‚Äôs not an overly spacious restaurant but the amount of space they had, it allowed customers to feel relaxed and created an intimate setting. The lighting fixtures were very pretty and can definitely tell they put a lot of time in planning out every detail about the restaurant. We ordered the Thai country style dumplings, crab Rangoon, sriracha wing, Phuket noodle soup with jumbo shrimp , chicken satay, shrimp skewers, steamed salmon with spicy lemon grass, forbidden brown rice, mai tai, and a lychee-tini cocktail. The Thai country style dumplings were stuffed with chicken and the soy vinaigrette dipping sauce was delicious. The crab Rangoon was my least favorite because it was too heavy on the cream cheese compared to the crab stick but the sweet chili sauce made it a tad bit better. The sriracha wings were crispy, not as spicy as I expected, and overall enjoyable. The Phuket noodle soup was definitely my favorite dish and every ingredient complimented each other. The broth was rich, had a nice kick to it, and just flat out amazing! The shrimp that was in the soup was perfectly grilled and flavorful. The chicken satay was tasty too and the peanut sauce didn‚Äôt overpower the dish. The shrimp skewers were tender, grilled nicely, and enjoyable to eat. The steamed salmon had a nice texture but lacked salt so ended up drowning it in the sauce that was provided. The spicy lemon grass sauce was delicious and ended up asking for more of it. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend the forbidden brown rice because it didn‚Äôt have any flavor whatsoever and was slightly over cooked. Both of our cocktails were great, they didn‚Äôt skimp on the alcohol, and the presentation was amazing as well.The staff were very attentive and continuously were checking up on us. I notice that the manager was roaming around and checking on every table. It was very nice to see how hands on everyone was and felt very appreciated. It may look like any ordinary Thai restaurant but don‚Äôt let the appearances fool you and the food is truly fantastic! This place is perfect for groups or 2-6 people, date night, girls night out, and more.
Bua Thai Ramen House exceeded my expectations. The outdoor dining d√©corwas stunning as was the inside of the restaurant. The stylish staff was informed about the menu and made great recommendations. I ordered a Pina Colada that was so flavorful, beautifully decorated -- and visually beautiful inside a pineapple. My friend ordered a Strawberry Sothe ‚Äì a beautifully decorated fruit cocktail that tastes like fresh berries. The lobster bun was both juicy and tender‚Äîa soft bun with generous amounts of lobster. My suggestion for the rock shrimp lychee is to eat it in one bite with the lycheee and experience the full burst of its flavor. The game changer for my friend & I was the Thai Phuket Ramen Noodle Soup---I have never had al-dente ramen, let alone it being the best Ramen I‚Äôve had in NYC‚Äîthe broth was so flavorful, we were addicted. It‚Äôs as good as what I have eaten in Thailand. All the dishes had fresh herbs that really enhanced each dish. Finally, we finished off with the Taro-crusted Brul√©e which was fresh and warm with unique flavors. There are many options for Vegans, vegetarians, and pescatarians. Their playlist was amazing and set the ambiance. I felt as though I was on a vacation and my friend and I will definitely be back.
The food and hospitality was IMPECCABLE! This is a perfect couples night out! For appetizers, we decided to get: chicken dumplings (fried) and the cevechi. They were both flavorful and is the epitome of an appetizer. For drinks we had the Bua Sangria (Red) and the Bangkok Mule. The Bua Sangria was served with fresh fruits which complemented the drink well. The mule was absolutely amazing 10/10 would definitely recommend!!! We filled our bellies worth the Miso Ramen (Roasted Chicken) and Clay Pit Fried Rice. The Miso ramen was swimming with flavor. For those who love Ramen and for those who don‚Äôt this dish will please all. The Clay Pot Fried Rice is chef recommended and you can taste why. Garnished with fresh herbs, greens and eggs it is almost to die for. The rice was perfectly cooked with soy sauce and infused with succulent sausages, pork, and FRESH CRAB MEAT. If you are a very picky foodie this is the most safe and perfect route to go. Lastly, we devoured the Fried Ice Cream. One bite and it felt like we were at a carnival eating funnel cake but with a twist. We were almost begging for another scoop. YOU CANNOT GO WRONG EATING AT THIS RESTAURANT! In fact do yourself the favor and visit Bua Thai Ramen and Bogata Grill. Visit their Instagram @buathatramenandbogatagrill and please check us out &getstuffed.nchill
I throughly enjoyed bua! It was a fantastic meal. From start to finish, essentially left the plates clean. I‚Äôd come back again 
I love Thai food and often eat in Thai restaurants when I get the chance. So on a recent trip to NYC with my wife we headed to 'Bua Thai' for dinner. On arrival the lady that seated us was a little grumpy but from there on in the service staff were friendly. The restaurant has a nice ambiance and decor but the floors / counters were filthy and in a desperate need of a deep clean. We had Chicken Satay, Fried Wontons and Crispy Spring Rolls to start, all of which were pretty good. I had the Pad Kee Mao with Crispy Pork for my main dish which I really enjoyed. Nice big portions too. My wife had the Pad See-Ew with duck which was also very tasty and large. Prices were fairly good for NYC with our 3 starters and 2 large main dishes coming to US$84 inc Tax. All in all I would recommend Bua Thai and we enjoyed our meal, however when you look around and see that the levels of general cleanliness are somewhat lacking it does make you wonder about the kitchen!
I must admit - when I saw how busy the restaurant was on a Tuesday night, I was nervous that I'd get short-changed on the hospitality. Wow, was I wrong! My sister and I were greeted promptly and we decided to sit outside. I was relieved that we were given enough time to explore their tremendous menu filled with vegan options, to my heart's delight.We decided to order the taro (sweet, bruleed crust of sugar) and shishito (not spicy at all, just yummy) small plates, and then I got the Thai Ramen Noodles with vegetarian duck and my sister got the Green Curry with vegetarian duck and vermicelli noodles (perfectly spicy and full of flavor). For dessert, we got the taro custard brulee which was shockingly delicious.One of the things that impressed me the most was how clean both of their bathroom stalls were, which is usually my tell-all for any restaurant. I love that even in the midst of a hectic night, hygiene is clearly a priority to this spot.Can't wait to go back and so excited to have discovered this gem!
Anytime I rate a place I always use the categories of -ambiance-service-food -bathrooms lol The establishment was so cute! So ambiance, check. The servers were very attentive, and always refilled my water without asking, check. The food was DELICIOUS and worth the money. I tried the Bangkok mule cocktail, sriracha chicken wings, chicken curry puffs, clay pot fried rice, ba mee gyo, and mango sticky rice. The wings were like the Thai version of Dallas bbqs sticky wings, the puff were perfectly flaky and flavorful, the fried rice was fluffy and tasty, and I loved the textures and different proteins of the Ba mee gyo. The Ba mee gyo broth on its own was delicious but the noodles plus the chip plus the crab and pork belly and bean sprouts‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ delicious! And to end the meal, the mango sticky rice was literally exactly what you think of when you think of mango sticky rice. Everything was soooo good, and I would definitely come here again. The indoor space was also very cute and the bathrooms were very clean :)

The place has amazing ambiance, food, and clean restaurant. They have great hostess/waitress that attends to all your needs. Plus DRINKS ARE AWESOME! one of the best Asian restaurant in the area! Must go
BUA Thai was extremely clean and has cute decor with wall plants and hanging plants. Also has a patio, which seemed like it would be nice in the Spring. However, my food experience with BUA Thai was not as organized as I would have liked. When we arrived, I gave the name for my reservation I had for 2 weeks and they sat us at the bar. That is fine - was just expecting a table with my reservation. It took awhile to order 2 drinks.After looking over the extensive menu we ordered our apps first and a few minutes later our entrees through the bartender. Our entrees came out 10 minutes before our appetizers and we had to ask for someone to bring the apps out. So we had 4 plates, while we were sitting at the bar, come out at one time. The steamed Thai dumplings were extremely dense and the dumpling wrappers were thick. The rice under the super crispy rice was cold. The tuna on top of the crispy rice was fresh and flavorful. Not sure if this is because our apps were forgotten in the kitchen, but we did not enjoy them as much as I would have hoped.The entrees (Japanese ramen and clay pot fried rice) were tasty and the drinks were perfect. I also ordered a yummy Thai ice tea with condensed milk.Overall would maybe try it again but just seemed disorganized and the apps were lacking.
This was my first time eating from a Thai restaurant and I was eager to try. I was invited to Bua Thai for a media dine. My boyfriend & I arrived on a VERY busy Friday night around 8:00pm which caused us to wait a while to be seated. I find the dimmed lights to make the ambiance very relaxing and it is definitely a great spot for date night.After being seated we ordered 2 drinks: Long Island iced tea and the Bangkok mule. They were both good. The appetizers we chose were the Lobster buns and Sriracha chicken wings. I loved everything about the lobster buns, especially the slices of avocado added to it. I highly recommend it! I ordered the Thai ramen noodles with crispy pork belly as my main course. A fault on my part was ordering the noodles with the salt soup base but overall it was good. My bf ordered the Gai Tod hat Yai (crispy chicken with sticky rice with sweet chili sauce on the side). The chicken itself was a little on the dry side. As other reviewers have mentioned the portions are large so the main course alone would be more than filling.I chose the taro br√ªl√©e for dessert based on its popularity and it was veryyyy good. It is served hot and was not too sweet. Lastly, the staff were attentive and the restrooms were clean. Overall a good dining experience. 
Full disclosure: I was invited to Bua for a media dine, and had the meal comped in exchange for providing an open, unbiased review. Luckily, I had done research beforehand and was not only pleasantly surprised by the number of other unbiased good reviews on multiple platforms, but had good word of mouth from a friend of my boyfriend's. Nonetheless, my boyfriend and I came to the UES (a rarity for both of us) with empty stomachs, open minds, but also open eyes for anything that seemed inflated.For starters, we came during the dinner rush and we actually had to wait for a table, but not for long. Immediately, I noticed how beautiful the decor was. Very modern and very clean. Once we were seated, we were given the following options: 2 appetizers, 2 entrees (excluding sushi), 2 drinks (alcoholic or otherwise) and 1 dessert to share.We looked at the VERY extensive and diverse menu and got to work. For drinks, we kept our requests simple: Sapporo for him, Tito's and soda for me. I saw it as a good litmus test of service quality to see if the simple things can be done well. Fortunately, they were. Next up, appetizers. We both went the bun/dumpling route, going with the duck buns and the Thai country style dumplings. The duck buns came out cold, which was a major ding, but nonetheless had decent flavor and texture, with a good plum sauce shining through. The Thai country style dumplings, however, were the star; crispy, crunchy, with savory meat flavor all the way through. They reminded me of a good dim sum treat. Round 3, time for entrees. We went with noodle entrees: Pad See Ew with shrimp and blue crab for me, and a classic chicken pad thai for him. These were both solid dishes that were hard to mess up. Everything was cooked to perfection and portions were HUGE. We both took home to-go containers.We finished off with dessert, we went with taro custard br√ªl√©e. Now I rarely have taro, as it's a bit of an acquired taste, but I really enjoyed the richness and mild sweetness of this dessert. It was a little on the firm side, however. Lastly, service was alright, though our waitress couldn't be kinder, so we tipped her about 20% despite the meal being comped.Overall, this is a solid 3.5/5. You wouldn't be disappointed eating here, you'd get a solid meal that's worth the money.
Such a cute spot in UES! Food and service was great, and I love the aesthetics of the restaurant. Serving sizes are huge and well worth it because we didn't finish all of our food, only took back a portion of it, and had like two+ servings of food left. There's a cute patio where most people opted to sit since it was warm out. We started with the mule and the chiangrai lychee martini. The mule came with a little vodka bottle which I thought was cute and the lychee martini was sweet and delicious. For appetizers we got the crab Rangoon and chicken curry puff. I really liked the chicken curry puffs and they tasted great even re-heated. Crab Rangoon was pretty standard. Clay pot was huge and was delicious! The pork belly is tender and the flavors are amazing. I love the bits of Chinese sausage in the rice and wished that there was more. We barely scratched the surface of this dish and took the rest home. The Ba Mee Gyo Moo with blue crab is a must-get. Amazing flavors and I personally liked the noodles that came with it, which was a thin but wavy spinach ramen noodle.Definitely wanted to give 5 stars for the food but we found what looked like a bug part(?) in the ramen. The staff apologize and very graciously offered multiple times to replace it or to give us a new to-go version. Not a huge deal personally since everything else seemed really fresh and clean.
Order the Claypot Fried Rice! Thai sausage, tender pork, CRAB, runny yolk boiled egg - everything comes together super deliciously and they do not hold back on portions. It was a lot of food - I'm literally eating my leftovers as I write this and I'm pretty happy about that. Don't regret not ordering it!We also got the panang curry with crispy duck which was also a winner. Super tender meat, fragrant curry and the portion was pretty hefty. The appetizers were tasty, but a little too pricey (we ordered live butter wrap and robata grilled shrimp). Mango with sticky rice was very very good. Definitely order if you have room for dessert! The drinks were also pretty boozy (we got mai tai and red sangria) which was great. Staff was attentive and friendly. The place was clean and stylish so great ambiance here! Would come back again for the entree, drinks, and all, but will definitely skip appetizers next time!*Please note that this meal was comped to write this review (honest feedback positive or negative)
*Disclosure: I received a complimentary meal at Bua Thai in exchange for my opinion. This review reflects my honest opinion of my experience*tl;dr: We had a wonderful experience at Bua. Patio seating was lovely. Service was great. The restaurant had great decor and was clean. But most importantly, the food was really good, and they gave us really generous portions of proteins in the entrees, which I loved. I did think the appetizers we ordered were lacking in portion size and substance, so I'd recommend skipping these and going for more of the entrees to share. Now for some more detail: AppetizersWe ordered the shrimp from the robata grill and live butter lettuce wrap. The shrimp was great, but for $12 I think there are better picks. I'd definitely skip the live butter lettuce wrap. While delicious, it's essentially an overpriced poke bowl wrapped in lettuce, and the portion was pretty small. EntreesGET. THE. CLAYPOT. FRIED. RICE. It's soooo good. I'll be thinking about this dish for a while. Rice is super fragrant, and they give you generous portions of pork belly and crab. Seriously just writing about it makes me want to go back. We also ordered a penang curry with crispy duck, and it was also amazing. We were a hesitant to order the crispy duck because we figured it wouldn't be crispy after soaking in the curry, but we were wrong. They get such a nice crisp on it that holds through the curry. Again, really generous portions of the duck, which I was happy to see. DessertWe had the mango sticky rice, which was bomb. Lately we've gotten the mango sticky rice at a few other restaurants (we won't name names), and none have stacked up to Bua's. Super fragrant rice, mango was very sweet, and the sauce had just the right amount of saltiness to bring out the flavors in the mango and rice. Overall, we had a wonderful experience at Bua. The staff were all super nice and attentive, the restaurant had a great look and feel, patio dining is always fun, and most importantly, the food and drinks were great. If I were you, I'd skip the appetizers and spend your money balling out on some of the entrees! Oh, and don't forget to order that claypot fried rice. It's the real deal.
If you‚Äôre wanting an extensive menu with a quaint atmosphere and delicious food, check out Bua. Had such a great dinner here tonight. For appetizers, we ordered the fried wonton and crab Rangoon. I love crab rangoon and this came with 10, super filled up pieces that were delicious. Nothing is worse than a lackluster Rangoon. I ordered the Ayudhaya soup with a spicy soy basil base and it was a darker / thicker soup filled with such great flavor. The amount of toppings in the soup is a great touch too! I am going to dream about the crispy pork belly. Was super impressed with the flavors of everything but also something to note is the presentation. All very nicely plated which is perfect for that Instagram moment. For locals of the Upper East Side: jealous you‚Äôre so close to this amazing joint. But totally worth the trip on the subway for a perfect meal. Will definitely be back!
Upon seeing some local foodies raving about this restaurant it made me all the more excited to try their dishes. My friend and I had the Chicken satay and tuna tartar appetizers, Panang curry and Ba Mee Gyo Moo Dang & Crab entrees, with Thai iced tea and a frozen cocktail. We shared the delicious taro custard dessert. While I wasn‚Äôt crazy about my dish (I forgot to ask for no cilantro) my favorite was def the chicken satay as it was flavorful and delicious with the peanut sauce. Portions were large so the price is reasonable- though will add up quickly! Service was excellent.
It‚Äôs no secret that the UES isn‚Äôt known for the quality of its culinary experiences, but this place is truly an exception. It‚Äôs a nice local Thai place with great friendly service and delicious food. We ordered curry puffs, Thai dumplings, a green noodle dish that comes with crab and pork belly, pad prik king with soft shell crab, and mango with sticky rice to finish. Everything was fresh and full of flavor. The curry puffs were incredible, flaky and flavorful and a must try. The dumplings were juicy and honestly you can never go wrong with dumplings. The green noodle dish is chef recommended and I can definitely understand why. It was a truly unique noodle dish, and one of my favorites of the night. Get this! Of course you have to finish things off with some sticky rice and mango. Their rendition comes with frozen mangos and whipped cream on the side in addition the classic coconut sauce topped sticky rice with sweet and tangy mangos. Delish! Highly recommend this spot if you‚Äôre in the area.
B√∫a Thai is a must visit restaurant for really great Thai Cuisine. All the food was made fresh and the flavors were spot on. The ambiance of the restaurant itself was beautiful and makes for a great spot to relax and enjoy your meal. The staff was excellent and very attentive. What I ordered: Appetizer:Super crispy rice Pok pok papaya with crispy pork bellyEntree: Pad Thai with shrimp and blue crab Ayudhaya Noodle Soup with roasted chickenDessert: Taro Custard Br√ªl√©e Drinks: pi√±a coladaThai coconut mojito The super crispy rice was so flavorful, I didn‚Äôt leave a single piece left and the noodle soup was really delicious. It was a rainy day when I visited and the soup was perfect, the flavors of the soup were so well balanced. When visiting, I definitely recommend a noodle soup!
Loved the food! Everything had generous portions and was super flavorful and fresh. The ambiance was stunning and the watermelon/pineapple drinks are so fun. Check it out for a fun and delicious time in nyc!
‚ÄúMy visit to this remarkable restaurant left me truly impressed! The ambiance is warm and inviting, making it an ideal spot for both special occasions and family gatherings. The staff goes above and beyond with their exceptional service, ensuring every detail is taken care of. However, the true standout is the food. Each dish is a culinary work of art, crafted with fresh, high-quality ingredients and presented with an artistic touch. The menu boasts a diverse range of options to cater to all tastes, and the portions are generous. I can‚Äôt sing the praises of this restaurant enough for its outstanding quality, culinary innovation, and unwavering dedication to the culinary arts. An unforgettable dining experience that I can‚Äôt wait to savor again!‚Äù üçΩÔ∏èüëèüëå
Been here multiple times, love the food and ambiance always. Came with coworkers and had a great night! Cocktails are fresh and yummy!
Colorful, playful and delicious! Such a good meal with fresh ingredients and well seasoned. Simply amazing.My wife loved the rice and noodle dishes.
The venue is very pleasant and the service is top class. We really enjoyed this restaurant. Seafood is very fresh, abundant and well cooked. The Tom yum soup is very authentic. The calamari is crispy and flavourful. The service is impeccable and very friendly and the price is very reasonable. This restaurant is a good experience.
Excellent service. The chaing Mai Ramen is one of the best Ramen items I've ever had in my life. The pork buns were delicious and the mango sticky rice was fresh. Highly recommended. 5/5.
This restaurant is espectacular, the food amazing 10/10 everything was really fresh and the presentation of the plates was Incredible
Amazing Thai restaurant on the Upper East Side! We came in for dinner on a Monday night and service was excellent - they were very attentive and our food came out quickly and super hot and fresh! We absolutely loved the chicken curry puffs and pork BBQ skewers as an appetizer. The Thai Basil noodle and chicken dishes were very flavorful and not TOO spicy but definitely had a kick. We will be back for sure - great neighborhood Thai spot for a casual dinner or date night!
Every dish was full of flavor and very fresh. Reasonably priced. Very large portions as well. Would recommend when in the upper east side.
Enjoyed everything we had! The wings and crispy duck fried rice were by far our favorite! The drinks were beautiful and tasted even better. The pina colada was too cute ! Such a cute spot in the upper East side. Can‚Äôt wait to go back. The service was great and had a chill vibe. 
This is such an excellent place to go to if you want a quick bite to eat,a full coarse meal or somewhere to just sit marvel at the aesthetics and have some great drinks. I have sooo much to say about this wonderful place that I definitely need to go back to very soon. When I first walked in I was more then amazed by the incredible display of flower walls all around and the ones hanging from the ceiling with twinkle lights. I already felt like I was in a fancy place but also in a fairytale almost. The service was also 5 star from the moment I was inmediately attended to as soon as I walked in to the moment I left after having such a delicious meal, appetizers, dessert and drinks. I say this because the lovely hostess named Kelly was super sweet, was also smiling so friendly and even helped me pick a meal I would enjoy. This alone made me want to come back here just to see this wonderful lady and have this service again. Not to mention the food is cooked thoroughly and soo well done in a beautiful unique presentation. I loved having super fresh shrimps here and delicious crab with the juiciest of flavors to them. Oh and the fried ice cream I had for the first time ever here was one to have me in cloud nine. I will definitely be coming back to eat this again and will bring even more of my loved ones here. I am already planning! This was truly a delight and such an honor to have been here. This review may seem hyped up but to be honest this place deserves all the hype and love you will love everything here so pleaseee check it out whether alone or with anyone. 
I had a great time at this restaurant! The vibe was right as soon as I walked in. Gorgeous instagram worthy decor and every dish came out quickly! The food tasted fresh and flavorful. I will definitely be back! 
We really enjoyed our weekend lunch at Bua Thai. The service was fast and efficient. Food was good quantity for the price and everything tasted fresh, fragrant and wholesome. The Thai Ramen was a delicious twist to our regular ramen and I recommend this.We tried Thai iced tea and soft shell crab in siracha sauceas well as spring rolls. 9/10The dessert was so delicious.

This is absolutely one of the best Thai Restaurant in UES. It is beautifully decor with lots of flowers hanging down. Perfect for a date or night out. They offer a unique and extensive Thai Food and ramen. Our cocktails are artfully crafted and comes in a whole fruit. Super friendly staff and all the foods were truly amazing. Very impressed with this spot and definitely will come back.
Beautiful spot! Gorgeous floral decor inside and outside. Awesome cocktails. Some are served in a whole watermelon, pineapple, or coconut! Delicious food! Our favorites were the chicken curry puffs and pad kee mao noodles. 
Bua is the restaurant you go to when you want ambiance, wonderful service, GREAT drinks, yummy food, guaranteed.The crab rangoons are the unsung hero of the appetizer menu. They literally melt in your mouth. Dip them in the sauce? Exquisite ü§åüèªNot into seafood? The chicken dumplings and sauce pairing were cooked to perfection. A classic dish you can count on.The pad thai is everything you want into a good pad thai and the presentation takes it to another level 11/10.The sauce to noodle ratio was spot on, and the consistency was perfect- you can easily indulge in the whole dish without feeling too full.A great UES staple!
4 stars for food, 2.5 stars for atmosphere, vibe, etc. I'll start with the negative. The place is stunning but in the back where we were seated was super cramped and we were packed in like cattle. On top of that, the staff were rearranging chairs and tables almost the whole time we were there to the point where we had to constantly shift in our seats to avoid being bumped by a person or chair. And the staff were also yelling at each other over all the other patrons trying to figure out how to literally pack more people in. As we looked around, it was clear many others were not enjoying their experience either. We picked this place based on reviews and because it was a 2 minute walk from the Comic Strip Live where we were going for a show. We had a 6:15 reservation.The postive was the food. Reasonable prices, nice portions that could be shared. The one miss for us was the baked crab hand roll. Not a ton of flavor. The crispy rice with spicy tuna and green curry with chicken were wonderful. Three drinks between us and our total tab was around $80. Nice prices for NYC...
This place is quaint but full of personality. The menu has so many amazing options and great variety, it was Thai food-elevated! The prices can't be beat-$16-18 for a HUGE bowl of authentic ramen on the upper east side?! I would make the trip out to the upper east side ANY time for this! We started off sharing the steamed chicken dumplings and crispy rice spicy tuna (legit to die for) and each enjoyed 2 cocktails I had the lychee martini and lychee mojito (ya girls got a thing for lychee) and Matt had the Bangkok Mule made with singha beer and a Mai Tai (highly recomend all four!) I've never had a real deal ramen bowl and green curry is my THANG so for me the Chiang Mai Curry ramen noodle bowl was an easy choice. It was packed with flavor & a whole leg chicken Maly husband had the Phuket Noodle bowl served with a spicy base, chicken meatballs and spinach. I've never had mango rice before, but always wanted to try it and tonight was the night This stuff is no dang joke LAWDD! We cleared our plates on every single dish and can't wait to come back again!
Hands down one of the best Thai food restaurants I have been to with phenomenal food & great service!Each dish was uniquely delicious & filled with so much flavor, my mouth is watering as im writing this!The things I tried:Bangkok Mule- loved every sip it! Def a must try & a signature drink of theirs! Crab Rangoon (10 pieces) Crispy fried wonton, stuffed with cream cheese, crab stick, scallion served with sweet chili sauce - perfect consistency & a creamy flavorful filling that pairs great with the sweet chili sauce. Rock Shrimp Lychee (8 pieces)- Crispy rock shrimp tossed with creamy lychee sauce. Another great appetizer that I‚Äôm so glad to have tried since I love shrimp! it‚Äôs on the sweet side & tastes amazing!Chiang Mai Curry Ramen Noodles (Spicy) Thai ramen noodle topped with coconut yellow curry with whole leg chicken, red onion, scallion, cilantro- This was under the chef recommendation & My absolute favorite! It wasn‚Äôt like anything I‚Äôve had before & it hit the spot! It was super flavorful & the broth of the noodles was creamy which made me love it even more! The chicken was a bit too over cooked making it hard to chew on but the flavors were perfect! Squeezing a bit of lime added another level of flavor. I highly recommend trying this dish!Taro Crusted Brulee- I love taro & I love creme br√ªl√©e so when I saw this, I instantly knew I would love it & I sure did! The taro consistency isn‚Äôt as smooth as creme br√ªl√©e but it‚Äôs worth every bite especially with the whips cream!It was an amazing experience & I definitely will be coming back for more! Shout out to Polly for being an awesome waitress!
I'm a huge fan of Thai food, and I'm so glad I found this spot! The food was all amazing and I'm excited to make the visit again soon even though I don't live too close. The staff is very attentive and super nice, and would check in to make sure everything was okay or to give updates on our food. They have an outdoor area which is great for the spring/summertime, we opted for that but the inside looked very spacious and modern too. So many of the menu options sounded delicious so it took me forever to decide on what to order. Portions were great and we ended up taking a lot home. What we ended up with:DRINKS (happy hour everyday 4-7pm!)Strawberry Sato - great summery drink, and pretty large tooLycheetini - loved this! has real lychee fruits tooAPPSFried Calamari - Didn't think I'd enjoy this as much as I would! The sauce paired really well with the calamariSuper Crispy RiceENTREESClay Pot Fried Rice - So much crab + pork belly on top, and flavor of the chinese sausage was perfect, the whole combo was on pointChiang Mai Curry Ramen Noodle - chicken was very tender, and comes with some fried ramen on top for different texture. Mild in spiceDESSERTMango Sticky Rice - At some other Thai places I've found the mango used isn't sweet or ripe enough, but it was perfect here.
My first Thai food experience, my first time dining at Bua Thai Ramen & Robata Grill, and certainly not my last of either! I visited last night and had a dining experience like no other. Although we had a few kind and attentive waitresses throughout the night, one in particular (although I unfortunately didn't catch her name) made my experience even more amazing. The menu is over 8 pages long--I have never seen a restaurant with such a large menu and variety in my entire life! I was amazed by all of the unique options.Our waitress gave us the most PERFECT recommendations. We wanted appetizers, and she started by explaining that customers' favorites are the Sriracha Wings and Crab Rangoons. She said that the Sriracha Wings weren't like the Sriracha I would usually think of--they weren't spicy and had a lot of flavor. Let me start by saying that they were the BEST wings I have ever had in my entire life. I'm not a wing nut (pun intended), but I do love sweet wings a lot, especially Teriyaki ones. My friend & I finished the whole plate (a generous amount!) and we could've eaten more! They were incredibly rich, tender, slightly crispy, and SO perfectly sweet with such an ideal amount of glaze/sauce. Please order them--they will change your life!I also ordered the Fried Taro, which was crispy and delicious. I expected it to be very sweet, like the Taro in Milk Tea, but instead it was the perfect balance between sweet and savory! The consistency was almost like Yucca, but not quite as grainy & dry. They were served with peanuts in each pancake, a lovely addition, and with a wonderful Sweet Chili Sauce with crumbled peanuts in it. It was the perfect sauce for these delights! The Edamame was also incredibly fresh and I loved the Himalayan Sea Salt with it! For dinner, our waitress recommended the Chiang Mai Curry Ramen Noodle--she said it was a traditional Thai dish served with crunchy noodles and that it was very popular with customers. If a wanted to try a signature dish, she explained, it would be this one. And I definitely wanted to try a signature dish!I was a bit worried that I wouldn't like the curry in the Chiang Mai and boy was I so, so surprised. The Coconut Yellow Curry was light and not thick & heavy. It was so sweet and the coconut flavor was prominent! The crunchy noodles on top were a fun & crispy addition--perfect with the noodles. The chicken leg was also very tender and delicious, and I usually don't like plain chicken! Our waitress also recommended the popular Sukhothai, Phuket, & Ayudhaya Ramen--she said the Ramen was a signature dish. Ramen is an essential, especially at Bua Thai, where it is phenomenal. My friend & I decided on the Phuket. The Phuket Noodle Thai Ramen was my absolute favorite. The Lemongrass soup base was spicy, sweet, and ever-so-slightly creamy, all at once! It was light and comforting as well. The soup base even flavored the noodles so deeply that each noodle became so sweet and flavorful. Their Ramen is especially fun--it's customizable & served with a skewer of mini Chicken Meatballs & Crispy Wontons! The Meatballs were tender, rich, sweet, and perfectly cooked. I was so full but I knew I simply had to try them... and I ended up finishing almost the whole skewer. A full belly is no match for this decadent food.The Crispy Wontons were a fun addition, and wonderfully crispy, as they sound! The Crispy Pork Belly was also tender, crispy (truly!), light, so easy to eat, and so perfectly cooked. The spinach and beansprout in the Ramen was a healthy and delicious addition as well... the spinach was SO fresh! The waitress recommended a hard-boiled egg too and I couldn't say no--they're my favorite and truly a staple to Ramen! It was so perfectly cooked. I love a good egg. The Pad Thai was also sweet, light, and PERFECT. I know this review is trailing on and on so long that it could become a novella, but if you've gotten this far, please hang in there! You've almost made it through!Now the drinks. The Thai Iced Tea is served in tall Kirin Ichiban beer glasses--a fun and delightful presentation. The traditional Thai Iced Tea (milk) was gently sweet, light, and almost calming. Usually I don't drink milk drinks during dinner, but it was actually soothing! The Lychee Thai Iced Tea was light, fruity, and sweet, with a big Lychee in it! So refreshing--I'm definitely a Lychee fan now. The Chiangrai Lycheetini was also an amazing & sweet alcoholic drink! For dessert we had the unique Taro Custard Brulee. Let me just say... once I started eating it, I couldn't stop! It just kept getting better and better! It had the perfect, crunchy sugar topping and a soft but firm custard beneath that. To sum up my experience:Warm, quaint, and cozy atmosphere. Kind staff. Simply amazing and truly fresh food. Cooked to perfection. Stunning presentation and attention to detail. The best food I have had in so long. Words cannot express. Thank you, Bua Thai. Please eat here!
There is no greater feeling then walking into a restaurant and knowing you made Happy Hour. That‚Äôs what happened when I walked into Bua Thai Ramen and Robata Grill. Buy one drink get one free? Sign me up! And they were DELICIOUS. I got a lychee martini while my friend got a ‚ÄúBangkok Mule‚Äù This Upper Eastside joint is definitely a hot spot with an awesome atmosphere. Everything from the decor to the dishes exuded a chill vibe. Upon walking in I was immediately greeted by a friendly host who sat us at a high top table (my favorite because it makes this short girl feel very tall) with just enough lighting where I could actually see my friend on a cold dark winter night. I even thought the bathroom was well decorated and fit the restaurants whole motif. The menu itself was extensive and had a ton of options to choose from with lots of vegetarian and vegan items. For appetizers we selected the fried wontons and a crispy duck bun. The fried wontons were stuffed with chicken and served with a sweet chili sauce. These wontons were perfectly fried and had a great ratio of meat to wonton. The portion size was surprisingly big for an appetizer. There were at least 6 wontons that came out with the order. The crispy duck bun was my favorite of the night. The bun itself was light and airy while the duck was cooked to perfection. Two come in an order and as my friend finished his first he tried to steal mine. But that wasn‚Äôt happening...Our main course arrived shortly after which was pineapple fried rice with chicken and a green curry noodle soup with Thai ramen noodles and crispy pork belly. The pineapple fried rice was beautifully plated, was very tasty and had huge chucks of chicken breast. Our green curry soup didn‚Äôt look too green, but it didn‚Äôt affect the taste in the slightest. With a 3 pepper rating (ones of the spiciest items on the menu) I thought steam might be coming out of my ears. While spicy enough it was still very tolerable. Once again the meat was cooked very well. All around this place was phenomenal. From the food to the service I was thoroughly impressed and I look forward to going back and trying more of what they have to offer.
Bua Thai Ramen & Robata Grill is a Classic Thai restaurant that serves delectable Thai dishes & cocktails served in a modern setting. This place is a gem! It far exceeded my expectations in both food and service. I have been eating through New York and I have to say that this place stood out. Bua Thai Ramen & Robata Grill was a ‚ÄúFeast for the Eyes.‚Äù The restaurant is pure Thai and is the best one at it. It‚Äôs a nice hangout spot. Their flavourful and scrumptious meals was an ultimate experience, their menu consists of incredible sequence of intricate and exquisite dishes.I went to Bua Thai Ramen & Robata Grill for dinner yesterday. I loved everything about this restaurant. The food, service and ambiance was beyond amazing!!! I enjoyed every single bite of my meal. Their food is so delicious and flavorful. They have a wide variety of scrumptious Thai cuisines. They made fresh food. That's what I loved about this restaurant. The dinning area is so perfect. I would highly recommend this restaurant to everyone! I will give two thumbs up to Bua Thai Ramen & Robata Grill !
Every time I visit New York from Canada, I always make an effort to eat here. The food is packed with flavour and well balanced; pad see ew being one of them. Cocktails were great as well, as I got this Melon drink (can‚Äôt remember the name). Felt like I was somewhere tropical. We sat on the patio and the weather wasn‚Äôt to hot nor cold. They even offered to turn the heater on if we were too cold. Staff is knowledgeable and friendly. Ambience is great as well with tons of flowers inside and outside of the restaurant
Came here on a Thursday night and it was a great vibe. To start, we ordered the pina colada and the mule. Both were tasty and strong. The pina colada came in a pineapple and it was so pretty!For the app - we got the mango salad and the larb mushroom. I liked both as the flavors were well balanced. For the main - we got the Phuket noodles and the ramen Thai Basil. Omg if you‚Äôve never had it, this is a must! Not too spicy, def bareable esp w the apps we got. If you still have room, do yourself a favor and get the mango sticky rice too
The ambiance was very great! Loved the decor!Second the drinks were all very good and well balanced! I ordered the berry margarita which was very good and refreshing!Their appetizers that I loved were the crab rangoon and tuna tarter.Their food range and variety were very good too! I had ordered the seafood phuket ramen which was very good. The mussels were fresh and didn‚Äôt have a sour taste which I loved! I would highly reconsider this place!
I came here for dinner with a friend, and wow we were both stuffed by the end of it. The portions are huge and the prices are in the $15-$30 range. I still have leftovers for 2 more meals.For the appetizer, I had the tuna tartare which reminds me a lot of sashimi. The tuna was very tender and had a tangy, fresh flavor. It was paired with avocado and lotus root crisps. It was a well balanced dish, flavor-wise.I had the spinach noodles which came with eggs, bean sprouts, pork belly, and blue crab meat with a side of soup. It was a huge dish and very satisfying. The broth was savory and hot.For dessert, I got the cold lychee in butterfly pea tea. This is definitely the most aesthetic dish that I had that night. The butterfly pea tea is a very pretty purple color. The lychee was already very sweet on its own and the butterfly pea tea was a bit sour so they paired nicely. It was sweet and refreshing.Everyone was very nice to us and service was pretty quick despite how busy they were. I definitely have to come back for one of their Thai ramen dishes, as that is what they're known for so I'm looking forward to my next visit for that.
Let me start of by saying that Bua Thai Ramen & Robata Grill is the perfect way to end your week! Delicious food and Happy Hour drinks with buy one get one free on their awesome cocktails :)The boo and I primarily went to Bua for a nice quiet sit-down dinner and Bua definitely met our expectations. There was ample outdoor seating but we preferred to stay inside where it was sleek, modern, and spacious. They definitely got their acoustics right because even with a full restaurant and music on we could still easily carry a conversation while sitting a good length across from each other.Now onto the food:Appetizers: Super Crispy Rice (from the Seafood Appetizer menu) - the Super Crispy Rice hit all the spots for us! The combination and freshness of the lobster salad with the spicy tuna was perfect. The flavors balanced each other and you can tell that real lobster was used! The only drawback is due to the size of the pieces it can get a little messy this is definitely not a fork and knife kind of appetizer so prepare to get your hands dirty :)Crispy Duck Bun - we were quite excited for this appetizer since we love buns in any way or form! But unfortunately this duck bun just didn't meet our expectations. The duck laid on top of a layer of greens with sauce slathered at the bottom onto the inner bun and all the flavors just didn't meet. You either tasted just the duck or the greens with the sauce but not all at once. The meat was also kind of dry with the bun being lukewarm. The only positive is the bun was stuffed with duck, as others have mentioned they really stuff their buns ;)Entrees:Ba Mee Gyo Moo Dang & Crab - a very interesting and tasty combo of spinach ramen (a first for us), roast pork, blue crab, spinach, and bean sprouts. The dish also comes with a side soup of some heavy delicious broth which I could drink all day long! This is one of Bua's signature dishes hence it being listed under Chef Recommendations and we highly recommend trying it!Clay Pot Fried Rice - now this was the standout of our entire meal (besides the Super Crispy Rice) the flavors all just flowed so well together. The ingredients list looks intimidating especially for what seems like a simple rice dish but let me tell you it was amazing, with every bite we just wanted more and more! If you are habitual with your meals then this is the meal to satisfy your habits. We will definitely get this dish every time we visit Bua!Dessert:Taro Crusted Brulee - to be honest this is the dish I was most looking forward to when choosing to eat at Bua and let me tell you it definitely satisfied my desires. I am a big fan of Asian desserts and it did not disappoint, one more item to add to my extensive list :)Chilled Lychee in Butterfly Pea Syrup - we decided to try this dessert due to how aesthetically pleasing it looks (largely the purplish color) and it was quite pleasant. If your a lychee lover then definitely get this!Overall we had an amazing experience with Bua with more hits then misses and cant wait to be back. The service was attentive and excellent as well!
Great FOOD, Attentive Service, Reasonable Price!I loved my experience at Bua Thai Ramen and Robata Grill. I loved enjoying a marg while sitting in their outdoor seating. . I ordered the super crispy rice for an appetizer- the fish was spicy and fresh atop perfectly crispy rice. highly reccomendThe Pad See Ew with Blue Crab and shrimp was delish! I loved how the protein was super fresh and not an option i see at many thai places. the portion was also super generous and lasted me for lunch at work for 2 more days!Lastly, I ordered the mango sticky rice for dessert. It was not too sweet and perfectly balanced.Loved my experience here- great selection on the menu, attentive and fast service.
I arrived for a 6pm reservation where I was kindly greeted in a timely fashion. I was seated in the back section with my partner. Our waiter took our drink and appetizer orders and informed us it was Happy Hour 2 for one martinis- $14 for 2,SCORE-Lychee martini is KILLER! Drink was made well and I appreciated the yummy lychee in my martini as it was a nice accoutrement.We ordered truffle edamame and fried tofu (which was very light and flavorful). Tofu was scrumptious! I especially loved the peanut sauce that was given as side sauce I‚Äôm taking half a star off for truffle edamame because there was WAY too much salt on them. Other than that, I really loved them! My partner and I shared Cashew Nut Chicken and Siracha fried rice. Portion sizes are quite large and veggies were very fresh. Both dishes were very flavorful and well-balanced. I tasted a kick to the siracha rice, but I was hoping for siracha on top of rice as well. Cashew nut chicken was very good. For dessert, we split a massive serving of chocolate fried ice cream. I had an orgasm in my mouth for real. It was amazing! Overall, I recommend this place. The restaurant itself is beautiful in a nice open area and smells delicious. 
Definitely order the crab Rangoon and the green curry. Best green curry since Thailand! Love it here.
So delicious and great service! I had the green curry and it was amazing. Service was quick and the outdoor seating was awesome. 
This is the best ramen experience I have had since moving to New York City! We ordered the Phuket Noodles with crispy pork belly and the Green Curry Noodles with chicken. Both flavor profiles were dynamite and certainly worth the trip to the UES. The atmosphere was lively and the food presentation was thoughtfully prepared. A great place for dinner with friends or a date night! We‚Äôll be back! 
Good food! Nice ambiance. Good tea and good location. Highly recommend the green tea and fried rice. 
This place was amazing, I went with my daughter and we both had a great time. For appetizers we got the chicken skewers and Crispy rice with spicy tuna simply delicious. And for dinner, i got the green curry thai ramen and my daughter got the Phuket Chicken thai ramen, and let me tell you its giving Japanese ramen a run for its money! We end with fried ice cream, I can't believe this was my first time having it here but it was elite, it tasted like vanilla wrapped in funnel cake, I took a quick trip to the state fair!! And the service was great as well, the waiters were courteous, and the food actually came out very quickly
Stopped by Bua for dinner & it was great! The menu has tons of options, it was so hard to choose, but we ended up getting the Crispy Tuna, Sriracha Soft Shell Crab, Massamun Curry & Green Curry Ramen. All the food was amazing, and I would definitely recommend the Pina Colada as well! Will definitely be back soon!
Service was nice and quickHuge selection of dishesThe green curry was advertised as spicy, and it was!
When I think of Thai food, I imagine food genuinely made in the tradition of Thailand and Thai culture - featuring robust flavors and ingredients that are traditional to the cuisine. And yet, somehow this place misses the mark so utterly it makes me question why Thai is in the restaurant name. We ordered Pad See Ew and Green curry and truly cannot understand how they‚Äôre called that. The noodles were over cooked and mushy, swimming in the sauce like it was a noodle soup. And for some reason, broccoli was used in replacement of Chinese broccoli - it didn‚Äôt work in the least. The green curry was a literal soup with the rice already in it. No consideration for a person‚Äôs preference of rice to curry ratio or the amount of spice, or even the allowance that the dish would be shared amongst the table. And as if that wasn‚Äôt enough, the service was horrible. Three people served 10 tables and somehow couldn‚Äôt spend the fraction of a moment to even look in our general direction.Call it what you want, but it isn‚Äôt Thai, that isn‚Äôt service, and it isn‚Äôt good.
Amazing ambiance, some of the best Thai food I've had between New York, Vancouver and Toronto (I've been around) and the freshest. Soooo many green vegetables- the healthiest meal I've probs ever had at a Thai restaurant. (I'm too proud of that eh?) I also appreciate the fact they have a nice bar to sit at, cuz I'm often eating solo. (Oh ya I still paired my healthy meal with some wine- I'm not an animal lol.)
Bua Thai Ramen & Roberta Grill is a floral paradise on the Upper East Side. Amidst the flowers, the Pina Colada in a pineapple is a must-try, and the Super Crunchy Rice sushi adds a delightful twist.The Crab Rangoons are crispy delights that shine amidst the blooms. The Green Chili Ramen brings a flavorful kick, while the Mango Sticky Rice is a sweet, floral finale.For a truly unique experience that blends ambiance and flavors, Bua Thai Ramen & Roberta Grill is where it's at.
I tried Bua Thai for the first time. I was really impressed by the lighting and decor. I was seated right away and my drink order was taken quickly. We had the Pina Colada served in a pineapple and the Bangkok Mule with a Tito's nip tucked in. We started with fried chicken dumplings and Sriracha wings. The sauce for the wings was perfection and the dumplings were nice and crunchy. For our entr√©e we had the Thai Ramen Basil with duck and Pineapple fried rice with beef. The presentation was nice and a good portion of food. The flavors were really fresh and spicy but not overpowering. We managed to save room for dessert. We had the green tea ice cream and chocolate fried ice cream. The green tea was light and delicious. I enjoyed the fried ice cream. The shell was almost like cake. I was totally stuffed but it was so worth it. The servers were very attentive. Our waiter checked on us frequently. We never had to wait for anything. Bua is great spot for a date night or to hang out with friends.
We enjoyed some ramen and a delicious basil fried rice and green curry! I recommend ordering the beef belly - nice and crispy!
Amazing portions, yummy food, and the green curry ramen was delicious. crab rangoon and the pork belly buns were the highlight
The service is really excellent here. The owner is very welcoming and makes recommendations from the menu. They use fresh herbs, tender meats, and everything has an authentic Indian taste. We really enjoyed it and will certainly go back.
We were ten people dining at Spice Symphony and everybody enjoyed the food. Fresh herbs, tender meats, very delicious.
Excellent! I need to eat vegan for health reasons and my Indian lunch was perfect - tasty and nicely presented. My spouse had the Chinese option. He is not vegetarian and was equally satisfied. While we had lunch late (about 2:30), we were quite pleased by how low the noise level was.
 Indian Chinese food is delicious and healthy meal. I haven't had this good outside of Mumbai. This place is clean, good ambiance and service. Another branch soon to open on 46 West.
First of all , Nisar, our host was amazing.. professional, friendly, offered suggestions from the menu after finding out what we liked to eat, and even offered my kids a delicious mango drink on the house! Yes, the food is Indian/Chinese/ Asian fusion and they manage to get it right. Definitely more for an Indian palette. Not your typical Chinese restaurant menu. All in all the food was fantastic!Trendy, yet authentic. Comfortable feel to the place. Clean and decorated beautifully. Service was exceptional. Would definitely go back and recommend to others. I also would suggest making a reservation.
Spice Symphony has amazing food. Nisar is an accommodating and lovely host. The restaurant is clean and comfortable. One of the best restaurants in NYC!
This Indian / indo China restaurant was located next door to our Hotel Th San Carlos just off Lex Avn and 50th E....Spotless and clean with friendly staff We called in once or twice and we must say that the food was amazing...middle of the road in regards to pricing but really worth a visit or call in for a pick up and these guys even deliver. There is only one price and no discount for take out...hey ho...still fabulous...!!!!
The food here was absolutely delicious and the service was fantastic. The staff here was very attentive and made sure we tried many items. We shared the chicken tikka masala, avocado kabob, and chicken biryani. I would highly recommend this place! (The only picture I have is of our clean plates!)
We were very satisfied by the services. Delicious food and drinks. The place was clean and we liked our waiter. We were also happy by their precautions concerning covid.
We made reservations for a friend's birthday. The moment we came in, we were greeted warmly. Covid restrictions were also followed. Our temperatures were taken, we were given hand sanitizers, everyone was wearing masks. The staff was attentive, nice and courteous and ready to answer all inquiries and accommodate our requests.FOOD WAS DELICIOUS. I definitely recommend the Mango Lassi. It's a very refreshing mango drink, perfect for all seasons. Presentation was great and serving size fits the price. My friend who's pretty peculiar about her food said that they have one of the most authentic Indian food they had ever tasted. They did not disappoint.The atmosphere was quiet, quaint and upscale looking. AND CLEAN. The place is very clean.Shout out to Nissar for the excellent service and recommendations. He made our night and it was truly one of the best birthday experiences ever.10/10 would definitely recommend and go there again!
We have been here several times now, and every time the food and service is wonderful. It‚Äôs a clean restaurant with an excellent staff, especially Nisar who goes out of his way to make sure the customer service is top notch. Excellent choice of restaurant, you won‚Äôt be disappointed.
My fianc√© and I live in the neighborhood and thought we would try a new Indian restaurant for a change and eat outside instead of getting takeout. We are so glad that we found Spice Symphony! Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious and there were far more unique options than the restaurant we typically get Indian food from. We shared the Gobi Manchurian Dry for an appetizer, and the Baghare Baingan and a side of Yellow Dal Tadka and laccha parantha bread for our main dish. Our server, Nissar, was so accommodating and helpful with any questions that we had! He even brought us a complimentary dessert (which was delicious) to end the night! We felt completely safe eating outside as the tables were well spaced and the block isn‚Äôt super busy with pedestrians. We were given hand sanitizer when we sat down and our silverware/napkins were wrapped in cellophane to keep things extra clean. We will absolutely be back! Definitely try the laccha parantha bread - it was delicious!
We would eat here every day if we could. The service is always friendly, the atmosphere reallt cozy and the place is very clean, the food incredible. You could go dressed up or down and always fit in. The shrimp appetizer and the hot and sour soup simply the best.
Came here on a recommendation. Staying by Time Square and this was the perfect walk. Arrived and we were seated immediately even though we were early for our reservation. We ordered the the butterfly shrimp which was delicious. Aldi was our server and he did a grata job getting our food and making sore that everything came out correct. We ordered the Shrimp Moliey and the Chicken Tikka Masala it comes out mild and I prefer the spicy so requested a little extra spice which added a nice kick that made it just right. Also ordered the Garlic and Cheese Naan . Also ordered the shrimp fried rice . For dessert we we the donuts and the rice pudding. Aldi also informed us that they have a great weekend brunch. This is definitely a great place to come while you‚Äôre visiting. Location is great and very clean and great atmosphere.
I would eat here every day if I could. Hands down best dinner we had on our trip. The service was friendly, the atmosphere was cozy and clean, the food was incredible. You could go dressed up or down and fit in. Get the shrimp appetizer and the hot and sour soup!
Good foodLoved the menu that offered an extensive choice of Indian regional cuisine and Indo-Chinese foodThe stand out was the service and thanks to Vijay who made that happen. He was professional, attentive, explained the menu well and made certain that our order was sufficient.The assistant/ Busboy (do not know his name) was also very attentive and made certain that the water was refilled, the tables were kept clean and the food served well.Will certainly visit again when in NYC
We had a wonderful experience! The food is superb! My friend is not a big fan of Indian food but we took her here and her mind was blow. Every dish was flavorful and delicious. We had the samosas, the cheese balls, the tikka chicken, the cashew dish and more. It‚Äôs a do not miss restaurant in NYC. I highly recommend reserving a table. The atmosphere is very clean and relaxing as well.
We go to Spice Symphony every time we come to NYC. Nisar ,our server, is gracious and accommodating. He always has wonderful suggestions. Atmosphere is pleasant and clean and menu is full of choices. We love it there ! See you in a couple months !!!
Larger than it looks from outside. Helpful staff. Busy often with groups of locals. Ideal for groups as such a mixed food choice. Food lovely. No longer open for breakfast.
Spicy Symphony is consistent on good quality. I eat here every time I come to NYC and I have a blast! Sometimes I visit this place more than once on my trip... üòù The butter chicken is the same as in India, and actually many locals frequent this restaurant too. The service is always exceptional!
The service is mediocre at best. We waited 45 minutes for a salad appetizer . It looked pathetic , dry, and totally uninspiring . The best part was that I did not get my cutlery for another 15 minutes. So I did not miss much . We returned the salad after a couple bites .My ordered the salmon and I ordered lamb vindoloo. The dishes are nothing special and absolutely do not justify this high rating .Any other local Indian place is just as good .Trip advisor really got this one wrong and was very misleading .
After 2 days local food I just booked a Indian restaurant. The food is different from the one served in EU but very good . Standard offer for Indian chicken tikka, shrimp coconut sauce, service friendly . But we had to wait long before having our table . Prices are average for NYC . Local customers and Indian which is always a good sign ... 
Food was delicious. Great ambience with friendly staff. Nisar was great and he gave us useful pointers on sight-seeing from a local‚Äôs perspective. We know where to go for our dinner next time we visit NY City!
We came in for dinner on Tuesday. We ordered Tandoori chicken wings, Garlic Naan, chicken rolls, lamb Vindaloo & Goan Fish Curry. As I‚Äôm writing this I‚Äôm eating my leftovers because it‚Äôs so delicious but my mouth was on FIRE at the restaurant so I couldn‚Äôt finish it. We couldn‚Äôt have asked for better service & hospitality. ALDI was fabulous. Attentive. Friendly & personable. He‚Äôs a great addition to a great restaurant. The entire staff was on point. The ambience was appropriate for the hour. If you‚Äôre a tourist or a local I highly recommend this place. Kudos to a terrific place in midtown! (I never give 5 stars. Spice Symphony gets 5 stars it‚Äôs that good)
We were staying local at the Hilton and I found this restaurant on trip advisor, it had such good reviews wanted to give it a try. We were not disappointed! My husband had a chicken tikka masala and I had chicken biryani - both thoroughly enjoyed our meals along with our naan bread. Our water was topped up without needing to ask, great service from staff and in particular our waiter Santoosh. I would recommend if in the area, or if you are looking for nice Indian food you will not be disappointed. I would recommend booking in advance as it was a popular choice. Great meal 
We found this gem local to our hotel on Lexington. Very nice food - my wife was particularly impressed with her chicken and sweetcorn soup. The waiter - Vijay - was both attentive and entertaining. Tomorrow is our last night so we won‚Äôt be able to return, but if I lived locally I would have no hesitation. 5*
Went here on a Friday evening while staying nearby purely based on Tripadvisor high ranking reviews. Got the chicken tikka masala and garlic naan bread. Rice looked like it was Uncle Bens long grain rice, sauce for chicken was bland with little flavour. Naan was ok. I do not mean to come across as a know it all but Indian food in the US is no where near the standards we have here in the UK. So if you are from the UK eating here do not expect anything amazing compared to the better dishes at far more good value we get in the UK. Even my local Camspice in Gt Eversden Cambridgeshire blows this place out of the water completely.
We were staying across the street and decided to try Spice Symphony based on reviews. We eat Indian food a lot and Spice was just excellent...with creative dishes done perfectly. The starters all looked good. The cauliflower soup was yummy and my lamb chops done to perfection. Eggplant dish as well topped off with mango ice cream. Aldi was an attentive waiter and offered good advice. Only critique was they seemed to push drinks (tho gently). Spice isn‚Äôt cheap but it‚Äôs an attractive restaurant with wonderful Indian food and a diverse crowd of mainly locals including Indian families and couples. 
I often eat a Phall in the UK, which is hotter than a vindaloo, and in most countries a vindaloo is not as hot as a vindaloo in the UK. So I was extremely glad when I requested a more spicy vindaloo and the waiter went out of his way to arrange it to be spicy along with requesting an off menu keema naan bread. The curry was excellent and this is the first time I had tried Indian in New York, and it will not be the last. I have found an excellent ‚Äúlocal‚Äù now! I recommend the place as it had supreme service. The cost is more than I would pay in Australia or the UK, but was reasonable for a NY restaurant.
Booked this restaurant as it was local and had fantastic reviews on trip advisor. We attended and it was extremely busy with people waiting for tables who hadn‚Äôt booked milling round by the door and bar area. This made it seem slightly chaotic but we were shown to our table quickly. The only issue it was right by the door which kept getting opened and being left open despite our complaint as it was -9 outside. Slightly off putting that when eating you are being glared at by other diners waiting to be seated. It might be advisable to put up a curtain / partition wall as those tables are very close to the door. We ordered typical Indian starters which were delicious paneer and spinach tempura they left high hopes for the main. I ordered chicken tikka masala an Indian staple and my husband lamb rogan josh with a pilau rice and naan to share. I was really disappointed the tikka masala tasted very strongly of what I can only describe as a beef stock pot quite salty and didn‚Äôt seem at all authentic as a massive fan of Indian food I was disappointed. The chicken was very dry and hard like it had been cooked gone cold then thrown back in the sauce I barely touched it and wasn‚Äôt asked why. My husband has better success with his lamb rogan josh but he only ate half. The naan was lovely but the pilau rice had whole vegetables and tasted very wet like it hadn‚Äôt been drained as opposed to dry and fluffy as you would expect. The price was reasonable and service was ok besides the seating location. Pretty disappointed with the mains and would have been better ordering a selection of starters. They did bring some complimentary ice cream at the end for our negative experience with the door being open and feeling very cold which was a nice touch. For the reviews I read I was disappointed overall especially with the mains. 
I don‚Äôt normally do reviews but Spice Symphony deserves special mention. The service was superb. Aldi was our waiter and he was attentive, friendly, and accommodated my kid‚Äôs request for butter chicken even though it wasn‚Äôt on the menu. He was the best! We also ordered lamb, salmon, a spicy shrimp salad, and peshwari naan. The food was excellent!! We have eaten at many Indian restaurants in the US and in London and this is up there with the best of them. The price was also quite reasonable, not cheap but also not over priced. I would highly recommend this place to anyone, locals and tourists alike!
Really neat place with great food and drinks. Happy to say we were probably the only tourist there at that time, lots of locals. I say that because I often find it to be a good/great sign.
Located on 50th st near Lexington Avenue this is worth a visit. Pleasant quiet place. Informed attentive waitstaff the menu has the usual variety of choices seen in NY Indian restaurants, but the menu has section devoted to ‚ÄúIndian Chinese ‚Äú items many of which are unique here. The dishes taste distinctly different from each other; most of what we had was very tasty. Unlike many Manhattan places, you get rice with your meal. Of note, they have 1947 brand Indian beer, which is brewed in Pennsylvania from a formula devised by local Indian expatriates. In addition to tasting good, it does not bloat you as most beers do and is a great accompaniment to the foodTry it!!
Ahmed and his staff were excellent, the food is fresh and simply superb; fantastic service & highly recommended. 
Found this spot when researching places to eat in mid-town. Myself and my wife went here for dinner one night and it didn't disappoint! Staff are very welcoming and the restaurant is lovely. Authentic and tasty indian food served. Generous portions and excellent service. We had starters, mains and gome nann bread....that was it....zero room for any deserts. If you like Indian food, I would recommend Spice Symphony. We will definitely go back next time we are in NY. 
Fantastic find. I live in NYC and was craving Indian food. I‚Äôm quite a connaisseur as I went to India many times. Nisar greeted us and was a great host, friendly and attentive. The naan was super fresh, the chicken avocado and sheesh kebabs moist and delicious, I will definitely come back. 
The atmosphere in the restaurant is wonderful. The food is very high quality, everything was fresh and tasty. The staff was excellent, our waiter Nisar gave an excellent recommendations. We really enjoyed the squash soup, the rice with the vegetables which were very special and of course the great tikka masala. Highly recommend ! an  ! excellent Indian restaurant in New York City
Do yourself a favor and visit this lovely restaurant. I have been there few times and i m still not over it. The service is unmatched. The staff truly cares about your experience. The food is absolutely amazing ‚Äì everything we ate tasted really amazing and fresh. The food makes you feel like home.. I would like to come back here again and again.Absolutely the best meal we had in a while . Highly recommend
Our hotel recommended this restaurant and made the reservation. From the moment we walked in we saw why it was recommended. The wait staff was friendly and welcoming as we entered. We ordered a bottle of wine and were able to enjoy a glass before ordering. They brought us a vegetable dumpling to start our meal and y he flavor was incredible. Such a delightful start to our meal. We had spring rolls and hot and sour soup as an appetizer. Both were amazing with a fresh taste and the perfect amount of spice. With no pressure to order we were able to enjoy our appetizers. For our entree we shared Chicken Tikka Masala which was fantastic. It had a slight smoky flavor and wasn‚Äôt too sweet. The naan bread that accompanied it was very tasty. The price was very reasonable for NYC. Definitely a restaurant we will visit again. Nisar was amazing and made us feel relaxed and not rushed at all with great recommendations. Definitely recommend!
What a wonderful experience. Nisar was our server and is the GM of the restaurant and he was very helpful in advice on the menu. Started with a Roselo cocktail that was delicious. Next, from the starter menu I had the Paneer Chili Dry appetizer paired with the Kachumber Salad. These both complimented one another perfectly and could be a meal in itself. Excellent!Next I had the Chili Chicken(Dry per recommendation) entree along with the Salt and Pepper Prawns (I know - more food than I could eat, but I wanted several tastes). This was accompanied by the Garlic Naan which was heavenly. I liked both dishes and would order them again, but since I was looking for spice, the Chili Chicken was my favorite. Each was spiced well and had the right amount of fresh spices and vegetables to round out a great meal. Wanted to go with rice pudding for dessert - but had already over eaten and will save it for next time.
Nisar was amazing and really made our dinner a wonderful experience. From service to food to ambience, we were so happy with Spice Symphony. We ordered the paneer chilli, the kofta, tadka dal and the fresh lime soda. The food was tasty, well cooked and freshly made. Will come again !
This restaurant is fantastic. Excellent service, shout out to James, outstanding meals that were freshly prepared and to specification (our daughter has a severe treenut allergy), and the vast selection of enteees are exactly what you are looking for when dining. we will definitely return.
On our recent visit to NYC, we found Spice Symphony so outstanding that we ate there twice, dinner and lunch. The food was fresh and the flavors came through brilliantly. Special credit goes to Nisar, the Maitre D who makes sure that everyone is happy. 
We‚Äôve been going to Spice Symphony on 51st Street (almost every weekend) since restaurants started opening up in NYC again. They have a great outdoor seating area, with large tables spaced far apart, umbrellas, greenery, always given hand sanitizer, and all staff are wearing masks. We are usually always greeted and served by Nisar. He is very attentive (and always makes sure we have cold ice water) and checks in to make sure our food is up to par. We are creatures of habit, so usually always get the same order. The chana masala and chicken tikka masala are on point! I always ask for extra mint sauce to spice it up even more. The garlic naan is absolutely delicious and I highly recommend it! Our food always comes out hot and fresh from the oven and plentiful. We always have delicious leftovers to take home. I would highly recommend coming here for great Indian food and a great outdoor atmosphere!
Our first dinner at Spice Symphony was outstanding. It was a warm summer night and we reserved a table in their lovely outdoor space at the curb, socially distanced. It was very comfortable, like a cozy pavilion. We've eaten at some of the finest Indian restaurants in Manhattan, and were not sure what to expect at this small midtown spot. The food at Spice Symphony was right up there with the best. We started with an appetizer: small, spicy quinoa patties with a bright green chutney. They were not on the menu but our server, Nisar, brought them with out cocktails. We also shared samosas, nan bread, vegetable biryani, and lamb seekh kabab, with a chilled bottle of wine. All the food was delicious with fresh, distinct flavors and just the right amount of spice and heat. Nisar explained some of the menu items and provided great service that was leisurely and relaxed. All in all, a delightful evening, and we will definitely be back.
Nisar and the staff treated us like family. This was our first visit and we had a great experience. The Tandori chicken was phenomenal and so were the Tandori lamb chops. The curried vegetables were fantastic and the garlic naan was so fresh and flavorful, and it doesn‚Äôt end there the cocktails and desserts are a must if you come here. We had the rose ice cream and the saffron donuts they were Scrumptious! We can‚Äôt say enough about the service we received at this restaurant... we will come back to this restaurant when we‚Äôre in New York again. You definitely won‚Äôt be disappointed with this gem!
We made reservations here for lunch today after seeing the Rockette's. We arrived early but they accommodated us quickly.They have a great wine list with reasonable prices. We both ordered the lunch special. It was a meat dish (I had lamb, my husband had chicken), 3 veggies, one was a spinach cheese dish (tasty and unique), chick pea dish, nan bread, rice, another unique lentil dish and dessert. This was $17, YES, $17, in NY. The best part was everything was hot, fresh, uniquely spiced and fabulous. Our server, Amit was attentive and helpful. Neither my husband or myself were familiar with Indian food but he managed to find a dish we both loved!I highly recommend this restaurant. Our best so far on our NY trip!!!
My wife and I had the sweet corn soup with chicken, the cheese balls with a cream sauce, the shrimp with coconut sauce and the garlic naan. Everything was delicious and freshly made. For desert we had the rice pudding with cardamom. This is Indian cooking at a high level and we will gladly return to try their Indian Chinese dishes.
The food is as fabulous as the manager, Nisar. He welcomed our whole family into his restaurant with such kindness. We just had carryout, but the inside was inviting and fun. Nisar was accommodating to us, providing plates so we could eat the food in our hotel room. When we returned to our hotel, we were delighted by every bite of each item-- the chicken lollipops, chicken Biryani, palak paneer, and Naan. The flavors were sophisticated, and the chicken was cooked to perfection (not dry!). I will say that even though we ordered the two entrees mild, they were rather spicy. I think spice varies across restaurants, chefs, and of course, palates. I do feel like better Indian cuisine is often prepared spicy, as it is more traditional. Check out this place. It is a ten!
This restaurant is must visit site when you are in New York.The food is incredible, the lights are dimmed and the whole place is just buzzing with the great smell of amazing food..During our recent stay, we went here 3 times for dinner..
It is easy to see why Spice Symphony is so highly rated (top ten restaurants in NYC at the time of me writing this review). The food is top notch and service next to none. Having visted with my family we each ordered 5 different mains - Lamb Rogan Josh, Chicken Korma, Chicken Avocado Kebab, Chana Masala and Shrimp Madras - (which the kitchen so kindly made up for me as its not on the menu, chef if you are reading this.. add it to your menu its one of the best i have had). On a whole everyone enjoyed their meals. Our waiter Nisar was fantastic! Super friendly and attentive, checking up on us to ensure we always had a drink on the table and to ensure all our meals were okay. If i am back in NY anytime soon I will make sure to visit again and will be recommending to all my friends!
We visited Spice Symphony and the Indian food we had was amazing. The whole place was a buzz , great atmosphere and the service was awesome, big thank you to our waiter Aldi , he really made us feel welcomed . This is a must place to go.. 
I am an Indian settled in UK and was visiting NY for family holiday. I am vegetarian, wife non vegetarian and kids have varying choices. The whole family fell in love with its food and we landed up going there 5 times while on a weeks holiday and which speaks itself about the food, ambience and service - all of which are great. I cannot remember each and everybody‚Äôs name (one name I can remember is Nisar) but they were all simply fabulous. 
Chose Spice Symphony based on reviews and were not disappointed. The food was navigable, delicious and included both healthy and traditional options. Even our waitstaff noticed the intent of our choices. Try the whole wheat naan, for example. And the tandoori shrimp was wonderful. 
The food was OK, the cost was high, but the whole visit was spoiled by the waiter. He was rude, repeatedly, and for no reason as far as I could see except for the fact that I wanted to order what I wanted, rather than the "chef's special" which he was pushing repeatedly & often.I cannot reiterate strongly enough, avoid this restaurant. Nobody needs to be made to feel bad when they are spending $60 a head.
We went to this restaurant as it had really good reviews. Dont get me wrong the food was lovely but the service was awful! Our waiter basically took the mickey out of us as soon as we got there and i got the feeling we just were not their type of people! It was insulting and i felt ashamed and degraded by the whole experience. I would NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to eat in a nice restaurant
Brought my visiting parents here for dinner after a long day touring the city. I booked this place after reading amazing reviews, so I was expecting good service. My expectations were blown away! Our waiter was Aldi, and he was perfect; he was so helpful, attentive, and accommodating. He even gave us an extra samosa because there were four of us at the table (the appetizer usually comes with three), which I thought was a very nice touch. Every dish we ordered was great- at our table we had the samosas, Murgh-e-Kalmi (whole Cornish hen), garlic naan, Avocado Chicken Kebab, Lamb Vindaloo, and Palak Paneer. The meats were tender and spice was perfect. For dessert we shared the gulab jamun. Soo good. The prices were extremely reasonable as well, and we left stuffed.The ambience was great as well- casual, light music playing in the background, and even though the place was full, we had no trouble hearing each other talking. Lighting was nice- nothing worse than horrible lighting to ruin an experience! Overall, my parents couldn't stop raving about the service and food- I'm glad I chose this place to help make their short trip to nyc a sweet one! We will be back!
We were looking for a place that would be interesting and tasty for us and also would work for our 8 year old grand-daughter for our first night in NYC. Spice Symphony was just the right place. The staff was very friendly and good about recommending dishes that would not be too spicy for a child but still be enjoyable for adults. We had chicken lettuce wraps for a starter, followed by chicken tikka masala, palak paneer, and garlic naan. We loved it all. It was plenty of food, reasonably priced, and our waiter could not have been nicer. The whole experience was a perfect start for our visit. 
We love our Indian curries! We were in NY looking for a good family meal and came across Spice Symphony - and what a great find. Not only is the selection of food, and flavourful use of spices, a reason for dining here, but the staff are amazing, attentive - but not overly so, making the whole experience superb! If you are in Midtown looking for some great Indian food, make sure S.S. is the place you visit.
In town for work, and found his little gem was next to our hotel. Didn't have reservations, bit only waited about 10 minutes for a table. The whole staff was overwhelmingly accommodating, especially Vijay, our waiter. We started with an order of samosas, that were cooked to perfection and delicious. Wet moved on to entr√©es of aloo gobi ? (Spiced cauliflower with potato), paneer in Korma sauce, stir fried chili vegetable, and of course, chicken tikka masala, along with rice and garlic naan. Everything was perfectly spiced and served hot.  We ended our meal with some hot tea and coffee, some trip ounce pudding and donught balls in syrup. We ate so much that we could hardly move! With this kind of food and service, we while be back everyone we are in town!
The food was great, the service exceptional and the ambience, perfect. There were many people in for a meal at the same time but even still, Aldi made sure the service we received was top notch. The whole family had a very memorable experience.
This restaurant lives up to all of the great reviews that it gets! This was one of the best dining experiences that I have had in a while. Not only was the food delicious, but the service was excellent. The restaurant was very clean with great decor. My family made a reservation for 6:45, and we walked out of the door at 8:00 (this included getting an appetizer, entrees, and desert) which is quite fast for such a nice restaurant. Food was brought out promptly and with high quality. We ordered samosas, lamb biryani, chicken tika masala, palak paneer, and a coconut caramel custard for desert. These dishes fed 3 people comfortably. Plus the whole meal was reasonably priced!There were lots of small details that made our dining experience much better. For example, when we were sharing our food family style, our waiter would come by and move dishes around, so that it was easier to serve. Waiters would also refill waters very promptly which other restaurants do not. Lastly, as we were walking out, the man who looked like the manager asked us how we liked our meal. These are just some small differences between good restaurants and excellent ones.I would recommend this restaurant to everyone. You don‚Äôt have to wear super fancy attire ‚Äî a little less than business casual would be perfect. By 7:30 on a Tuesday, the restaurant was almost full, so I would recommend making a reservation through open table. This restaurant was definitely a fantastic choice for dinner!
The food was excellent here and the waiter was great at helping us choose items we‚Äôd never had before. He basically chose our whole meal in the end including the wine and everything was superb. Would definitely return. 
Really good food! And a great experiencce. We did not have reservations and the place is really small but we got slots at the small bar and decided to eat there. The bartender (Prem) was a pure joy! Our server (Dev) was also great and full of info. These folks are very passonate about their food.
I'd never profess to being a huge fan of Indian cuisine (I like it in doses, but typically don't love) but my wife and I wanted a dinner somewhat spicy and leaning Asian, and as we were staying at the Lexington Hotel, Spice Symphony was worth a try...and blew our socks off! The cuisine was FANTASTIC, and the restaurant has a very cool vibe; low-key, music like you'd hear getting a massage. So relaxing. Items very fairly priced. The owner, manager and staff couldn't be nicer. We felt very much at home. We started with the crisp spinach tempura (Chaat) as it sounded unique. It was packed with flavor and so delicate. The chicken manchow soup was delicious; went with a "heat level" of 6 out of 10 and it was just spicy enough without going overboard; packed with flavor that perfectly balanced the soy sauce undertones with Indian spices. Excellent starters! For main courses we split the Chicken Vindaloo and Chicken Manchurian; both dynamic. The vindaloo brought the heat with a tasty red sauce. The manchurian was phenomenal; sauce was great and made for great dipping with the Garlic Naan. Will go out of the way to dine here again, highly recommended!
Just back from dinner here with my wife. Despite the cramped dining room, the experience was too notch. Service was 5 star and the food was out of this world. I travel to India quite often for business and have eaten in some of the best restaurants there. This is at least equal or better. Perhaps it's the indo-chinese, but the flavors were wonderful and balanced perfectly. We started w the Gobi Manchurian and chicken lollypops. Both pop with flavor and texture. We also had the Palik Paneer, chicken Tika masala and roti. Can't wait to return. Yum!
Loved this restaurant last year while in NYC and was not disappointed this year! I can‚Äôt get enough of the Madras curried vegetables. I should just order 2 servings from the beginning and ask for a take out container, as I treasure it for breakfast the next morning. That‚Äôs how good it is! Order the Raita too for a nice balance to the curry. Don‚Äôt miss the Naan bread selection. I get the garlic, but my husband tried the Peshawari with dried fruits and almonds and it was amazing, well balanced and not sweet. The shrimp Piri Piri was a perfect starter. I‚Äôm already looking forward to my next trips dinner here! üòã Thank you Vijay for great service! 
This is going to be a short review:The Indian food was delicious. The staff was very friendly and helpfull.The toilet was clean.The price/quality was well-balanced.Go there.
Well 4+ stars really. First night in New York City and staying across the street in the excellent Kimberly. Indian restaurants can be mixed quality but this was excellent. Flavours well balanced and provided range for a family of 4 with different tastes. Nice balance of spices and not too overpowering. I would recommend the tandoori shrimps. Amit was a very attentive waiter and included a complimentary taster starter and desert. The home made mango ice cream was delicious. 
Attentive service, reasonable prices, and food that is on point. My wife and I tried Spice Symphony on 50th St on our recent trip to NY to see a show. The staff was friendly, and the toughest part was narrowing down what to order. The chicken wing lollipops were a lice start to the meal. The chef provided a complimentary vegetable dumpling - and I wished I could fill a suitcase of them to take home. My wife and I each had tandoori bbq dishes along with the garlic naan. All really well balanced spices. If I lived here, I think this would quickly become comfort food.
Having travelled to India more than 50 times, and eaten Indian food around the world, this is as good as it gets. The delicate blend of spices were balanced in both the entrees we had. The service was very attentive , relaxed and efficient.
A fantastic find close to Times Square! We were so pleased with the incredible food and the phenomenal service (shout-out to Nisar!) Every single item was well thought out and balanced in terms of flavor, spice and presentation. The staff was super friendly and well informed about the menu. Nisar, our host, made great recommendations of Gobi Manchurian and Chicken Lollipops - being from Delhi originally, it took me back home :) thank you Spice Symphony for that. We were visiting from Texas but cannot wait till we come back. Order anything - you will not be disappointed! Bravo to the owners, management, staff and above all the fantastic food!
This establishment lives up to the hype on its reviews. Bottom line..... the food is amazing. Every dish we enjoyed balanced a complex blend of flavors with high quality ingredients. Our waiter Santosh was excited about the alacrity with which we devoured the meal and quipped ‚Äú my grandmother would be so proud of this table!‚Äù My wife is gluten free and there are many options. The lamb chop was very likely the best we have ever had as well as the coconut shrimp dish. I hesitate to give specifics because everything we had was terrific and we cannot wait to go back. Thanks so much!!! 
On E50th opposite the Kimberley Hotel this restaurant looks unassuming from the outside. Inside however, it‚Äôs smart and professional with plenty of space and a nice ambience. The food was very good - well spiced, good quality and well balanced flavours. The service was ok but too obtrusive for my taste. There were lots of waiting staff just hanging around which was off putting. 
We were looking for something different for dinner and decided to go Indian. The restaurant itself is unpretentious and small from the outside. Once inside, the ambience was warm and staff were welcoming. The maitre d' was most attentive and clearly took pride in the food. Our mains consisted of Goan fish curry and the lamb dhaniwal korma - both exquisite in taste with finely balanced spices. For sides, we had the mixed vegetable korma and dal made from kidney beans and lentils. It is unusual to walk into a restaurant on speck and sample what can only be described as a 5-star meal.
I went here on the recommendation of my husband, who had dinner here a month ago with a friend. I was only able to come for lunch, although I want to return for dinner! The restaurant is notable for having a peaceful, calm ambience. It's not fancy, but it's very pleasant, and stands out compared to other midtown eateries in being quiet and spacious. I was served quickly, but was encouraged to take all the time I needed. I ordered the lunch special shrimp curry thalli on the recommendation of my waiter. It was really delicious, with well-balanced spices. For a quick meal for one person, it was a great way to have many complementary dishes together. The dish included the curry, a cauliflower side dish, lentils, rice, raita, pickle, and naan. There was a lovely small dessert to follow. My husband tells me the lamb vindaloo was spicy hot and delicious. I can't wait to return!
Some of the best Indian food I‚Äôve had. The seasoning of the food is well balanced. Really enjoyed it
My wife and I had an amazing meal here last night. We chose the shrimp and chicken starters which were delicious. The shrimp was spicy but well balanced. We chose the Lamb Rogan josh and chicken tikka masala for the main served with naan freshly baked on the premises. The best part about the curry was the complex blend of spices and the fact that the paste was a perfect consistency with no grease at all....We eat Indian style food in England all the time and thought that this meal was exceptional. ‚ÄúThe best we have ever had‚Äù.....Service was really good to with lots of contact throughout the meal... Rakesh was particularly good and made us feel welcome. We recommend that you check this place out !
Our flight into New York City was delayed a couple of hours and we arrived late, tired, and hungry. After checking into our hotel, 50 NYC, we walked across the street to Spice Symphony for dinner. We were pleasantly surprise by an inviting environment, wonderful wait staff, and an amazing menu. Our waiter, Aldi, answered all our questions about the menu and made suggestions based upon our preferences. The dishes were perfectly prepared with a variety of well balanced spices and beautifully presented. They also have a full bar and great wine list. If you like Indian food, you can‚Äôt go wrong! 
Found them on TripAdvisor and they exceeded my high expectations. I went for lunch today and had the Salt & Pepper Prawns with steamed rice (under $20). Shrimp cooked perfectly and the flavors were fantastic- green onions, peppers in a great sauce. Full of spices, but not hot, just flavorful. Ambiance and service is five star. You can't go wrong here
I visited Spice Symphony together with my girlfriend in september 2016. Even though the place doesnt look like much from the outside, it is a must-visit if you like indian food. The food is excellent - wonderfully flavored and nicely presented. Try the samosas with the fresh, minty green sauce. So good!
Numero 28 is a brick oven pizza restaurant on Carmine Street in the Village. Most of the staff is Italian and ingredients for the pizza (flour, cheese and meats) are imported from Italy. Friendly, down to earth and centrally located off the West 4 subway station, its one of my favorite places to dine and meet with friends. My husband and I are especially fond of the "delicatta" pizza! Tonight's montepulciano wine was delicious.
I rarely write scathing reviews - I am a glass half full, there's always some shimmering hope of positivity - kind of girl - but as far as this west village location of Numero 28 goes - my advice is firm: AVOID this piece of crap place. I made a reservation weeks in advance, because I wanted a large table - for 12 - early in the evening for our mothers day dinner - it was a big deal. We wanted killer food at decent price - in a family atmosphere. Well - the occasion was bombed to hell and back, here's why: - even though there were several large tables in the dining room they insisted on seating us right in front of the wood oven and waiters' walk way - so when we weren't sweltering from the oven's heat we were getting plowed over by servers. - they haphazardly took our orders, then proceeded in delivering our food piece meal over the course of 3 hours. They specifically asked us when we wanted our appetizers and salads (we want them BEFORE the entree) and then they brought 2 of the 4 pizza's out first, no appetizers for 30 - 40 minutes later - 2 hours later they brought the final 2 entree's - but no final pizza - when asked about the final pizza they acted totally surprised, and then told me it was "in the oven" It finally arrived at the 2.5 hour mark - while the rest of the table was dreaming about how soon they could leave - UGH - this was after we asked several times about our pizza and final entree's - REALLY BAD SERVICE - GRADE F - so yeah the pizza was delish (not a rare find in this city) but if you're thinking that ordering to go would still be OK - then please note: my beau watched with sickening awareness as the waitress knocked a slice off one of the serving planks (en route to someone's table that came 2 hours after us) and then she reached over and put the slice back on the plank (from the floor) to go serve. Yeah - if you want the best of NYC's slime and street garbage- on your pizza for some extra flavor - then make your way over to this piece of crap restaurant. But you might want to do yourself a favor and NOT. Numero 28 - you screwed me on my Mother's Day dinner celebration, then you charged me full bill - I was too angry to argue, but you SO deserve any negative fall out that comes from this review - including a stern visit from the health inspector. UGH
Super friendly staff served us a great fresh clean salad and a couples pizza that is half mushroom w truffle and sausage w peppers, also amazing. Thin crust. Perfect amount of sauce. Tasty toppings. Thank you!
Staff was very friendly and seated us right away. Menu had good selection. Kids loved the meatballs. Clean and fast service.
The food was really good. It came out hot and fresh and the staff was really friendly. They provided excellent service. The place is clean and well kept.
They are so kind and servicing. The place is clean and organize. And the food is very good. The services was fast. 
Excellent service and food. Some of the best pizza I‚Äôve ever had! Add in clean bathrooms, chill ambiance, and loved ones, and sprinkle in some Italian being spoken here and there‚Äîthat was our wonderful experience! Thank you!!
So we were going for a walk next to our hotel (Yotel) and stumbled upon this little restaurant. Priced were fair and it was very clean. Let's try it!Wow! the pizza was absolutely fantastic!The service was on point.Best part of it is, we had a nice walk afterwards to digest all this yummy food.
The location is small but quaint. Part of the charm. Noise level can get high. The reception was very professional with a personal touch. The menu is exciting. Typical but not. Point is you can enjoy trying. The property is clean. It is tight but cozy. The service was very good. The food was fresh and flavorful.The presentation of the dishes are near picturesque. Now the flavors are different from what most expect. Very good blend of spices on all we ordered, with exception to Lentil Soup. It was fresh just not bursting with flavor like the other dishes.The pizza was done in their style. Good blend of ingredients and served hot. Pricing is fair. Well worth the visit. If there were fractions in this rating system it would get 4.75. Go enjoy and have fun with the full experience.
On our last night in NYC, we decided we wanted pizza. This place was the top ranking pizza place in NYC so we decided to give it a try. It's a small diner in the Washington Square area. Restaurant was clean, staff friendly. We got the medium size pizza that comes in a rectangle. Pizza looked delicious but I've seriously had much better pizza in NYC and where I live in KC. This pizza is kind of a thin crust and most of it was soggy on the bottom and had way too much sauce. The pepperoni is also spicy. I thought the pepperoni was great but one of girls I was with didn't like it all. We had a great time that night but I doubt I'll be back. They also only accept cash so come prepared. They do have an ATM there so that's helpful also. 
Stumbled across this unassuming little restaurant with a big Italian heart! Whilst out exploring this great city! From the off we were transported to the old country, the staff were very attentive and were willing to accommodate our every need! The food was absolutely magic from the starter through to desert! The menu is simple, less is more. The food is fresh, clean and needs to be sampled! Well done guys keep up the good work! 
What a magical find!!! I travelled to NYC with family and friends in July. One of our grouped raved about Joe's pizza which is located a short distance up the road however when we got there it didn't quite live up to its reputation dude to this we decided to find an alternative restaurant to eat at, this is when we found N√∫mero 28. We were welcomed inside by a very friendly young 'authentic' Italian female who showed us to a table. Service was good we were served drinks within a reasonable time and food orders were taken with the waitress more than happy to explain the various dishes. The restaurant was clean and tidy and although the toilets were bijou they were sufficient for what you need. The food was something else, I had garlic mushrooms on bread followed by bolognaise and pasta, portions were huge and although sufficiently full decided I had to try the recommended 'Grandma's cake', what can I say I was blown away moist, suttle and soooooo tasty all handmade in house. All in all a magical find I could not fault the rustic style restaurant, amazing food or service. If I return to NYC this will definitely deserve a second visit. 
We had two different pizzas along with lasagna.....What more could a person ask for. The place was super cute & clean. 
Super cute and cozy with amazing pizza. Service impeccable that made us feel welcome. Love the mis-matched wooden tables and rustic Italian interior. 
The pasta and pizzas were delicious! Kid-friendly, as well. Cash only though. Has outdoor seating with doors open for indoors, so didn‚Äôt feel stuffy.
My family and I had a wonderful lunch experience at Numero 28. The food was amazing! It is now my favorite NY pizza place and that‚Äôs saying a lot because we have tried a lot of pizza places! Our waitress, Donatella was both attentive and kind. She answered all of our questions about the menu and had wonderful recommendations, as well. A must try for anyone in NYC, tourists and locals alike!
Visited last night the West Village branch. . Did not book. We‚Äôre lucky to get a table as it was very busy so would recommend booking. Pizzas were great. Carbonara was undercooked and salty. Good vibe. Had ice cream from local shop afterwards and sat in the park to eat. Would recommend fir an evening out with family . 
this is my neighborhood spot for Naples style pizza and its the real deal here in NYC! incredible quality of ingredients and the absolute best part is the atmosphere! Donatella is amazing and makes you feel right at home. just brought my two friends from Beirut / Madrid here last night, everyone always loves it! highly recommended by a New Yorker of Italian descent who's spent time in Napoli.
Local friend brought me here while I was in town for World Pride. Wide choice of pizzas in different sizes.We ordered the 5 cheese with speck and the potato pizza without sauce. Both were superb! Had a beer that the waiter recommended that was great. Prices were reasonable. Service was great, and the outside seating was festive and added to the experience of being in the Village.The only downside is that this is a cash-only establishment- they have an ATM on site though.Definitely would return!
I usually eat out in Manhattan a few times a month - but never pizza.We have a good local place, closer to home, thats usually good - when they make it the way I request & I always request thin crust.And lets face it, when you've eaten pizza all over Italy there is never a comparison to be had.Might I also add that, I LOVE PIZZA!And the pizza here was amazing - so good in fact in a blindfold test I would be certain I was eating pizza in Italy.Service was wonderful & they only accept cash.Go!
We flew in from the UK on the Friday at noon. After a walk round we had a reservation here at 8pm.We were shattered and after a few bars in the area turned up around 7pm. They understood fully and got us seated straight away. The meatballs? Oh my!! They were incredible, really tasty, the sauce was just as good, perfect. Me and my partner shared a pizza with sausage and a variety of other stuff, was excellent!Everyone else in the place were local, you could tell they come here with their family all the time.The staff were superb, catered for us with no issue. Will be going back for sure, maybe even again on this trip. Just note that it's cash only. 
Myself and my brother read the reviews on trip advisor and decided it was worth a try on our first evening in NYC.We had stuffed foccacia to start, followed by an 18 inch Romeo (prosciutto and artichoke) pizza. Both were extremely tasty. We were very full afterwards!The restaurant itself is a family friendly place that is cosy, warm and inviting. There appeared to be locals there which is always a good sign. The staff were friendly. That said, we were waiting over 20 minutes after we were finished our main course before anyone asked if we were ok or wanted anything else. In that time we went from thinking about dessert to just getting the bill.
Felt like a stop in Italy with the chatter of Italian all around us and the authentic food that was ample and delicious. Cozy restaurant that patrons packed into because the offerings are tasty. Our waitress was helpful in her suggestions. Clearly a draw for the locals and well worth finding for a tourist.
Gnocchi and lasagne with red wine. Beautiful. Simply beautiful and good value for money. I'd recommend reservations as it's busy especially with the local new yorkers. Staff are great and well worth the money. 
Very happy we decided to try this small Italian eatery in the west village area.Everything was deliciously prepared in a comfortable family friendly environment.While the tables were close together the noise level was nice to carry on a pleasant conversation.We shared family style so we could sample many dishes. The calamari and meatballs for appetizers was a perfect start. The kale salad and the pear salad provided a nice light course before sharing two small pizzas. I will say the numero 28 pizza was definitely worth ordering.The prices were very fair for the amount of food we received. We shared a bottle of wine which was also priced fairly.One mention is that they only accept cash. While an ATM is available on the premises just be prepared. Needing cash is certainly no reason to pass this little local establishment by.Will stop in again on a future visit.
On my recent trip back to NYC, I spent majority of my time in my old neighborhood of Greenwich Village. I was so happy to see Numero 28 is still in the hood. They have a warm, inviting atmosphere and delicious pizza. It's the perfect place for some fresh ingredients, and hand crafted brick oven pizza. I love the thin crust! 
A top finalist for favorite mis-shaped thin crest pizza pie in NYC. A nice local Soho pizza joint, authentic and well intentioned owners.Sit down and enjoy it hot out of the oven, with or without extensive toppings, you won't be disappointed with the choice if its a thin crust wood oven hand thrown pizza you crave.I've come back here with colleagues, friends or even alone many times while woking/visiting the area.
I'm a native New Yorker who grew up in Brooklyn and numero 28 is one of my favorite pizzas! Super fresh ingredients on razor thin dough! The carmine street location has an old school rustic feel while the Brooklyn location a bit more chic and with live music on certain days. 
Great pizza!!! Great atmosphere and we loved the service! Very fresh ingredients and the wine was excellent! Must try!
Wow!! Party in ma mouth !!! Great pizza great pasta .. so fresh amazing red wine too !! I will def come back !
Absolutely delicious pizza (Italian style)! Very fresh ingredients. The ambiance is low key and cozy. Seems like a neighborhood hot spot. Fantastic service, our server Sam was tremendous.
Great spot to grab lunch. Fresh tasting ingredients on great pizza. And exceptionally friendly service! 
had a fabulous time enjoying a variety of delicious pizzas, perfectly paired with a diverse selection of wines, all in a warm and welcoming environment.
Been to numero 28 a couple years ago before the pandemic and on this visit years later things are still as great as I remember. We ordered a family size pizza and chose 3 flavors vegeteriano, margherita with added anchovies, and tartufo. Everything is delicious and fresh. Our arugula based Rucola salad was soooo good. The portions are generous, the service is great and fast. This was a belated birthday dinner from my sister as i was away a couple of days ago on my actual birthdate and it still felt amazing and special. Highly recommend!!!
We had a pleasant time at this place. The food was fresh and service was perfect. Sammy took care of us and offered us drinks! Exceptional pizza and pastas.
Great pizza, tastes super fresh. The ambiance is also super cute - inside or outside. The service is also very quick even when busy. 
Great location. Amazing pizza. Think crust and sweet sauce with fresh mozzarella and plenty of basil. Deserts are top notch too. 
Had a great experience with my friends for dinner! The pizza is really tasty and fresh. Super friendly staff
Sammy was amazing! The food was super fresh and reasonable. The chocolate panecotta was beyond.. great lunch with my girls 
Delicious and fresh! Great service Sammy! The kale salad with avocado was nicely dressed and the perfect size.
Best pizza we have had in a long time! Truffle sauce was amazing. Prosciutto was so fresh. The couple was perfect was for two people. 
Excellent service and food! The pizza was fresh and the flavor was incredible. Definitely worth the money and experience. We will be back to try the pasta and salad too. 
I'm not sure I would make a return. We arrived on a Friday afternoon around 2:00 PM to a very small and empty place. The server was on the phone in the back. When she finished her call, she sat us. The table tops were sticky/tacky. Our paper napkins stuck to them and ripped when we tried to pick them up. I also was surprised at the limited beer options. For a pizza joint, I had hoped for more. The server had no idea what kinds of beers they had. She knew the name, but not what it was.I did like our food. It was truly enjoyable. It was fresh, tasty with perfectly cooked crust that crunched on every bite. Our bill came to $110 with tip. I'm glad we had on hand to pay the bill. For a fee, there is an ATM in the bathroom (odd place for it) if you need one.Our whole visit took about an hour. The wait time for the pizza to be cooked was about 30 minutes. It's made fresh, so it takes awhile.
We found this place by pure coincidence while walking in Soho. It is little South Italy on New York. La seniorita was friendly and prelofessional with a special Italian touch that makes you feel instantly at home. Authentic ingredients. Excellent Pizzas. Tasty Pasta. The Chocolatte cake a home made desert was absolute heaven. La Mamina offered us a second portion on the house ( adorable attention). Do not miss!!
Christina was our charming wonderful server tonight we had the white pizza with Gorgonzola and pear. The food was impeccable the wine wonderful the ambiance of dining out on the patio pure romance . Absolutely a remarkable addition to our trip to New York after seeing the off broadway play collective rage. Our last night in New York finish!
Wonderful appetisers (calamari and meatballs ordered), perfectly cooked blistered-base pizze with imported mozzarella di bufala and a short but decent wine list (we had the Primitivo) made for a great lunch. Staff were really friendly and localised Italians - 2 great guys - who balanced attentiveness with courtesy nicely. Only disappointment was a rather long doppio espresso and a burnt-ish espresso macchiato....get this right and you guys get 5 stars!Era ottima!!!
The pizza is good! Excellent crust, good sauce. We had the truffle pizza high was great, and the margarita with green olives, both great. 
I have no idea how this place got so highly rated.Service was horrible and food almost as bad.Waitress took forever to appear, brought out things disjointedly and disappeared. Really terrible.Bruschetta was tomatoes on toast. Pear salad was greens, a few slices of pear, one walnut, one cheese crumble. 
My boyfriend and I were looking for a good, sit-down pizza dinner and I chose this place based on the reviews here. It did not disappoint! I tried a lovely small pie with artichoke hearts, mushrooms, fresh green olives, and ham - and it was AMAZING. I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of delicious pizza places to choose from in NYC but this one is definitely worth a try.
This is one of the BEST pizza places I have ever been to. If I had the choice, I would give this fantastic place 10 stars! There is a choice of pizzas which are all very yummy, and come very fast. The service is incredibly fast. My friends and I ordered a 29 inch pie, and it came in 10 minutes.  The pizzas only come in pies, and are cash only. There in a ATM inside. This helps a lot! When I went on a family trip to Italy, I had some very tasty pizza but this pizza, Mmmm!So good. If you prefer olives on the pizza, there are fresh green olives. You must go to this place. So good. It is very close to a train station and next to NYU. One of the best places ever. I hope you enjoy!
Just a clarification - the Numero 28 we ate at is on 2nd Avenue on the West side of New York city. This is the only one I could find, so, hopefully, they are owned by the same people.We shared a lovely salad, which was full of olives, artichoke hearts, greens, and wonderfully shaved park cheese, lightly dressed. Hubby had a bowl of macaroni with eggplant. I had their lasagna. It was very reminiscent of Italy, with b√©chamel, delicious meat, cheese, and, of course, pasta! Fortunately we had exactly enough cash!!! Yes, they have an ATM in the back of the restaurant.....It was a wonderful day and we enjoyed our Italian treat greatly!
It had been almost a year since we dined here and were excited to experience the renewed restaurant now that chef Rocco DiSpirito helms the kitchen. This is a long, detailed review, so if you‚Äôd rather cut to the bottom line for us it‚Äôs this: we had a wonderful waiter, got to sit in a comfy booth with a view of the chef working in the kitchen, the special grill items were really excellent, my salmon was disappointing but cheerfully got replaced, the sea bass and baked Alaska were very good. We‚Äôd probably return. Now here‚Äôs our dinner in detail ...We had one of the first reservations of the evening and we were a few minutes early, so we had to wait in the cafe area for a bit until they were done getting ready for service. That was fine, although the cafe staff seemed a bit perplexed that we were sitting there and came to tell us we should order drinks directly from the bartender. It took me a moment to realize that they didn‚Äôt know that we were awaiting a table in the dining room and perhaps thought we were awaiting cafe bar service.In a short while we got seated in a nice corner booth adjacent to the open kitchen in the dining room. We were very happy about this so that we could see what was happening in the kitchen a little from time-to-time. My husband particularly got to see a bit of Chef Rocco in action in the kitchen, which was an added bonus. I‚Äôve read that they‚Äôve done a bit of redecorating since the previous incarnation of the restaurant but frankly I didn‚Äôt notice the changes. There still is the penny-laden floor, the vaulted ceiling, and the dark wood. The tufted leather booth was comfy! I really began to feel comfortable, though, when several staff members stopped by to tell me they loved my ‚ÄúSchitt‚Äôs Creek‚Äô t-shirt and we got to chat for a minute here and there about my favorite TV show ever! Our server, Rodrigo, turned out not just to be a fan of the show (so he and me and my hubby got to bond a bit here and there) but also ended up being a delightful, service-oriented, efficient, attentive and caring waiter. He really was wonderful and is a great example of why NYC dining experiences can be better than anywhere.Being always a bit skeptical about food trends/gimmicks, we weren‚Äôt sure how we felt about the White Oak charcoal hunk in our water carafe, although the water tasted good (but so does NYC tap water). The amuse bouche was a tasty bite of smoked salmon and coconut creme fraiche on a nutty cracker-like ‚ÄúGame Changing Toast.‚Äù It was really deelish. The restaurant features a number of items cooked on a Binchotan grill which apparently uses White Oak and gets temperatures approaching 1000 degrees Fahrenheit. The restaurant does still have the word ‚Äúgrill‚Äù in its name, after all. So even though I tend to stay away from skewers we ordered three different ones as starters -- one was bluefin toro, another was wild shrimp wrapped in sea lettuce and a third was some sort of scallop. All were really substantial for skewers and had a simplicity that was also complex somehow -- with a little sweetness to them. They arrive on a wheeled table with the Binchotan grill (looks like a box) and the waiter plucked them off the grill and into serving bowls for us. We were surprisingly happy.For entrees we continued with seafood. Hubby got the poached Black Sea Bass with green olives and a red pepper puree and I got the organic Norwegian Salmon with fennel-glazed beets and cashew cream. My first bite of my entree was soooo good -- a beautiful balance of sweet and salty and I insisted my hubby take a bite but as I was finishing that first forkful I detected a bit of fishiness. I gave him a bite and he felt it was fishy, too. My second bite confirmed. In the meantime he was loving his sea bass. Rodrigo came by at just the right time to check on us and we told him about my salmon and he whisked my plate off to the kitchen for Chef Rocco to investigate. Here‚Äôs where a wonderful NYC waiter shines. He came back saying that Chef Rocco tasted my plate and thought it was fine, but that if I‚Äôd like to switch entrees he‚Äôd be happy to. I ended up ordering what hubby had and really liked it, even though I usually don‚Äôt go for red pepper purees. The sea bass was light and delicate but somehow stood up to the saltiness of the green olives. We split a lovely little Mandarin Baked Alaska for dessert and it was not only beautiful but the orange, chocolate and meringue was a nice combo of tart, sweet, and bitter. Good!I noticed that Chef Rocco came out into the dining room to greet some tables and take a photo with one of the patrons. Since we have no ‚ÄúVIP‚Äù status nor do we know him, he didn‚Äôt stop by our table, and we didn‚Äôt expect him to. He actually is cooking on the line here, so it was a treat to get a glimpse of an award-winning chef ‚Äúdoing his thing‚Äù in the kitchen. The real ‚Äústar‚Äù of our little dinner, though, was Rodrigo!When it was time for the bill to arrive, Rodrigo gracefully mentioned that they took the salmon entree off of our bill, which was much appreciated. We felt well taken care of. On our trip home we discussed how we felt about the restaurant -- we agreed that it wasn‚Äôt life-changing but it was quite good and the service was spectacular. Since then I‚Äôve read Pete Well‚Äôs NY Times review, we are inspired to come back and try some of the grilled beef entrees one of these days.
Adorable Christmas Candyland area just outside it and the Biergarten on the opposite side are both fantastic, but this restaurant was a disappointment. Boring menu; burger was average at best (thin, not juicy); fries were lame; service so-so. Our group ordered a few organic doughnuts to share, but we didn‚Äôt realize until after the first bite that they were vegan. I generally like vegan food, but these doughnuts were seriously disgusting ‚Äî like stale cardboard. 4 out of the 4 people who each tried a bite agreed. Why even put them on the menu? I can‚Äôt recommend this place. There are way too many truly fabulous restaurants in the city to waste your time or money here. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.
Lovely place , with a nice terrasse outside, to have perfect doughnuts, organic eggs (mexican way with nachos) and fresh kale salad to balance everything. Very good !
They feature organic and farm to table produce and meats. The menu changes frequently and they are very accommodating. If you want a quiet place to visit or a casual meeting there is lounge behind the bar that is nice and a little less of a scene. 
This area of Manhattan - thanks to the High Line and the New Whitney Museum - is something to behold. Wow! Everything feels new, different, and exciting including the numerous old and new places to eat and drink. The Standard Grill is a bustling and extremely pleasant eatery close to the Whitney and the High Line and has a brunch menu that is quite varied and diverse with choices that range from quite reasonable to ridiculously expensive. My Grilled Tuna with Fennel, Olives, Soft Herbs, and Shishito Vinaigrette was excellent. The chef knew how to serve grilled tuna rare just perfectly. My brunch companion was quite happy with his Turkey Sandwich with Avocado, Cucumber, Lemon Aioli on 7-Grain Bread. I loved mine, but I wanted his, too!. Standard Grill has lots and lots of choices like cheeses, cured meats, organic eggs, a great many sides, and an extensive brunch cocktail menu. Their raw bar includes a number of items that will drain your wallet if you're not careful, but generally the prices are fair and reasonable. Our server, Caroline, was quite efficient and helpful and had the nicest smile in New York on November 21st! Easy to recommend this eatery. I imagine their dinner menu is just as good and, probably, even better.
We truly enjoyed a birthday dinner that included three generations of our family. Service was just great (Robert).I always find that when they keep your water glass full, they also give you good service. The drinks were served as requested. The choices of the appetizers were good, including oysters, mushroom soup and salads. The octopus appetizer was octopus, perhaps another octopus would have enjoyed it better. Entrees were excellent. I had the trout. I love good fish and found this extremely good. The scallops were excellent and large but the portion was very meager four (I would recommend making another choice). Chicken was also excellent but I question if you really want to order a chicken meal in this nice restaurant. If you love organic chicken that have a go at it. The salmon was also very good, it was equivalent to any other salmon that you may order in any other top locale. One of the children ordered the hamburger, it was also excellent served with nice fries, bacon etc. All of the desert choices were excellent, lots of different goodies The d√©cor was quite different. White vaulted ceilings made with recovered old subway tiles. The floors contained thousands of copper pennies and the toilet facilities were designed in a very modern and different way. The interior designers were quite astute concerning the likes and dislikes of the affluent hipster population that have become assimilated in the cobble stone streets of the former Meat distributor warehouses of this District. The decibel level was acceptable for a busy NYC restaurant. The table cloths apparently helped to insulate the diners from an abusive level found in other NYC restaurants. A comfortable conversation could easily be had here
We had the opportunity to drop in the Standard Grill beneath the Standard Hotel. As expected, the meal and service were excellent. We were seated at the chef's table, which we found very interesting and entertaining. We started with the Steak Tartare √† Go-Go and the Chicken Liver Royale. Both were excellent. (Two people can share the Chicken Liver Royale!) For our main courses we had the Flash Seared Lamb Chops a la Plancha, Rosemary, Crisp Confit Potatoes & Cucumber, which was excellent. I had the Organic Berkshire Pork Chop, Warm Bacon & Potato Salad, Apple-Fig Chutney. The service was outstanding and we'll be back again soon.
We had breakfast there - one of the few places open for breakfast with outside seating in the Meatpacking district. Great choices of organic food, pricey but excellent. Very friendly and attentive service.
Had two really good meals here:1. a breakfast meeting here on a work trip. Don‚Äôt sleep on the steak and eggs with chimichurri butter. I am still scheming on how to make it at home here in Seattle. The space was great - tons of lovely natural light coming in, coffee was good (I think it‚Äôs La Colombe), etc. I can‚Äôt think of a place I‚Äôd rather sit down and have coffee and read a newspaper than this joint. Can I get one next door to my place next?2. A really nice dinner with some old friends in the grill. Feels super swanky and New York, I love this space. Would be good for dates, good for dinner with coworkers, whatever. Stuff on the menu I liked was the ceviche, the steak tartare, the duck breast, the pork chop, and those crispy potatoes. Double up on the potatoes. Killer.
Had an amazing time here! The vibe was impeccable, the wine list was great. I'm a natural wine enthusiast and they have great options. Loved the orange that they pour by the glass. Snacks were tasty and tasteful. Overall an elegant experience that was super fun. Chris and team are the best! My favorite new go to when in FiDi!
5 stars even though they didn‚Äôt have any natural wines and a variety of challenges ALL of them absolved by the incredibly Juan Infante who is now my new friend. Truly a gracious and kind host. The location is great and frankly food better than Pastis and the 1$ happy hour Oysters are a nice bonus.
We had a business dinner and the chance to get a table outside Food is very good , location awesome but The best was the service We ordered French red wine and said we are from austria .The offered us one Glas of the most characteristic wines from austria for free - a natural wine - which actually - only wine insiders know and honor line the Best restaurants in Copenhagen I was more than positive surprised 
Had brunch a few times, but quality has gone down. Its just bit better than diner food. The space is cool and I'd recommend eating out near the bar area where the natural lighting makes it more interesting. Convininent location for highline and whitney and shopping in chelsea market even.
Casual friendly grill with a buzz. Clientele included couples as well as young families.Had the lobster roll which was delicious, and the fries a cut above the norm. Efficient energetic staff.nice ambiance during day with lots of natural light. Understand it's a different crowd and mood in the evenings. Will return
Native NYC-ers, we had not been to The Standard in years and were delighted by a recent visit. We were greeted by a friendly staff, whose affable vibe continued throughout the meal. Huge emphasis on locally-sourced foods and almost the entire menu is gluten-free. While many restaurants tout this, DiSpirito elevates his ingredients in creative and tasty marriages and the sum surpasses the parts. Beet tartare is silken and the sweet earthiness of the beets is balanced by the zing of capers and horseradish. Tuna tartare accented with herbs tastes fresh and new. The affable chef altered his signature shrimp-and-truffle risotto to substitute chicken when we weren't hankering for more seafood. Topped with a generous pile of shaved truffle, the result was, well, yummy. Extensive wine list with eclectic choices and a knowledgeable sommelier willing to suggest options off the beaten path. Chef Rocco DiSpirito's hands-on care shines. We'll definitely return soon.
If you are walking the high line and looking for lunch or dinner then this is a must .The balance of flavours in the cocktails was spot on all made from fresh herbs . Take a look at the list and sample a few they really are well done .We were just after a basic late lunch warm bread buns with An ashy flavour ,Americian burger and pastrami on toasted multi grain with pickles .Exceptional service 
I‚Äôve always believed that the most important meal for a hotel restaurant is not dinner, but brunch. Those of us who are waking and not wanting to make any strenuous trek to a dining destination find a luxurious bonus in being able to stumble onto an elevator and walk a few feet to find sustenance. In the case of the Standard Grill at the Standard High Line, it‚Äôs a destination in its own right. From the stylish staff (attired in Burberry-inspired plaid) to the cozy atmosphere ‚Äì perfect for a holiday weekend ‚Äì the Standard Grill provides a brunch that rises above the average, much like its host hotel. Though there was a bit of a wait on a bustling Sunday, that‚Äôs to be expected at prime brunch time. The service is otherwise friendly and attentive to make up for it, but the food is where the place gets to shine.I opted for a standard Eggs Benedict with micro greens and fresh herbs, the latter making all the difference in the world, elevating the hollandaise sauce to new heights. The importance of fresh herbs and greens, even as an accent, should never be underestimated, and the Standard wisely employs them in perfect proportions and placement. The waffle dish, served with a towering pile of freshly-whipped bourbon cream that simply soars to the ceiling, is a decadent delight, set off by tart spiced apples and topped with pecans. The waffle itself is light and fluffy, with the slightest outer crunch. Even the healthier option of fresh berries, Greek yogurt and granola (the choice of my dining partner) astounds with flavor and richness. There is also an interesting selection of fresh juices available if you‚Äôre trying to justify the Benedict or the waffle (in addition to the usual brunch cocktail fare). I opted for the ‚ÄòHigh C‚Äô ‚Äì watermelon, ginger and grapefruit ‚Äì which was a nice balance of sour and sweet, gentle and biting. A lovely entry into brunch ‚Äì soft but with the slightest edge ‚Äì not unlike this gorgeous brunch spot.
We sat in the back section which is more formal and dark as opposed to the white windowed bar portion at the front. Nice big comfy booth. Good selection of food choices at reasonable prices. We had the eggs Benedict and omelet which were both very tasty, large portions, omelet was served with herbed home fries and toast. We finished our meal by sharing a bowl of fresh berries. Great service. Would definitely visit again!
Maybe it depends when you hit it, but we had a great experience with breakfast at The Standard Grill. Went on a Monday morning around 10:30am so its was not crowded at all and we were seated right away at an outside table as requested. Breakfast sandwich with substituted scrambled instead of fried egg was tasty. Omelets were perfectly cooked, moist but not runny, with your choice of about a dozen fillings. The side potatoes were very addictively flavorful with fresh rosemary and thyme herbs. And sourdough side hit the spot. Not a big coffee drinker but their decaf was one of the best I've had, served in individual pots for those drinking regular. Service was good, order came fast, but we never saw our server after the food was ordered...maybe a shift change because we received our bill from a new face that was working the outside. Would like to try it for dinner to get a better feel for the place, but as for now, we would definitely have breakfast here again.
Just finished walking the Highline in 100degree heat. Saw a sign from the Health Department giving this non-descript building an A. Was greeted immediately with a welcoming smile, and escorted to a table way in the back. Wow this place is huge. The hostess noticed I was checking out the lighting and asked if this table was okay? We were seated and promptly served water and asked for our drink order. I had the chopped veggie salad, my father had a BLT club. The salad was just the right size, not the enormous portion that you usually see in the city. Very tasty. The BLT was typically big and we took home a 1/4. Cost of meal $30.Not only was the server attentive throughout the meal, but they also have a water server. I mean the pitcher of cold water was on the table, but someone noticed my empty glass and came over to refill it for me. That is service.The menu is not extensive, but would appear to have something everyone could enjoy. They seem to lean toward items containing fish.
I had a wonderful experience. The service was high quality and very clean and refreshing as soon as you walk through the doors. The staff is wonderful. The food was delicious hands down!!! The steak was impeccable, like no other. My server Juan was very attentive to my needs and provided excellent service along with the hostess Lana and Teresa which were wonderful. They were very fast, friendly, and sociable. This restaurant is really worth my money and I will definitely be going again!!!! I would give it 10 stars if I could.
Went here for late breakfast/early lunch and was not disapointed.My wife had advacado on toast with bacon and sausage and I had eggs benedict with bacon.Service was attentive, environment was pleasant and clean and the food was delicious. The proces however were on the high side for what we had - $80 for the two of us (inc tip).
This was given to me as a suggested great place to eat and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed at all. The ambiance in the restaurant was electric. The decor exciting and clean. The food selection and choices were awesome. Maybe a little pricy but it is in Manhattan..!! Service as always great and not an user.Many thanks and hopefully see you soon 
Staff was so friendly. Food was so good and drinks were even better. Had some clean eating options which was really cool to see. 
My first ever visit to NYC and this place had been recommended by local residents. Boy what a fabulous surprise this was.We arrived for around 11 am for Brunch and had the most incredible vegetarian burgers that you could almost believe it was meat. The flavours were stunning.If you are a lover of oysters then this really is the place for you. I just had to have an oyster shooter and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed.There are 2 restaurants here, we were in the back one where it seemed very family orientated and totally lovely.The place was absolutely packed by 1pmThe service was 10/10 and we were looked after by the very handsome Mark.OM Goodness we had the champagne punchbowl to drink. Not to be recommended for 2 people, we were just being greedy üòÅIt was absolutely wonderful.This place had such a lovely warm feel about it and so many locals here too.We couldn‚Äôt have been made more welcome.Clean toilets downstairs. Ladies keep to the left otherwise you end up in the mens toilets like I did. A little confusing. Look down on the floor where you‚Äôll see to go.Highly Recommend 
Great food and a very correct price. Also very good to visit with kids. Good choices. clean restrooms
We were seated in the bar area of this casual and rather noisy restaurant. Clientele were mostly younger than our 50's - 70's group but we did not feel out of place. Location in the meatpacking district was easy to get to by car (we came from CT). Others came by taxi with no problems. My wife and I had turkey sandwiches which come with a salad of greens. No need to order much else, but we did enjoy the desserts, especially the marinated pear and apple crisp. Wine-by-the-glass selection was good and our server was outstanding. Restrooms are clean and spacious by NYC standards. Meal was a bit pricey but we had several drinks during our 4 hour stay.
It's The Standard right? The hip place where JayZ and Beyonc√© choose to fight. We were there and decided to try it for lunch. There are 2 seating areas: a cafe and a clubby dining room. We chose a banquet in the dining room which was a great vantage point to observe hotel guests and locals dine. Most staff was gracious and accommodating though not necessarily well trained or experienced. We were adults celebrating a birthday and splurged on caviar to start followed by our main course. Regretfully everything arrived at once. I specifically said we will have 'caviar to start'. Our server was inexperienced but the kitchen expediter should have had a clue. When everything arrived, I commented everything at once??? Runners said there you go and ran off- what was I to do? Have them take the hot dishes back to dry out? Not wanting to make a fuss and make my birthday guest uncomfortable, we proceeded with the "buffet" approach to lunch. Caviar service was lacking the usual accruements-disappointing. To be fair, the main courses were tasty and well prepared. Thus the 3 point rating. Also annoying was the public feeling, less than clean bathroom. Go if you must but don't be disappointed, it's just ok.
We came here after our hotel concierge recommended it for breakfast/brunch. The restaurant wasn't busy and there were a lot of staff! Initially we sat in the sunshine but it was too hot so a few minutes after we arrived I asked if we could sit in the shade. The various waitresses looked confused and it seemed the table they wanted to seat us at was still dirty and no one could manage to clean it. Eventually they did and we ordered and breakfast arrived but my side order of bacon didn't. When we asked for it, the waiter lied and said it was "just coming" and 15 minutes later it turned up, by which point I had finished. They took it off the bill and took off one coffee but for what they charge, you would have expected better food and better service. Recommend breakfast across the road at Bubby's instead!
Visiting from the UK, seated early in a curved leather booth near the entrance, we felt we had a wonderful New York lunch: steak salads, generous cocktails, courteous and attentive service. Despite the quiet streets, it was completely full (Monday lunch). Just be aware that the (clean, modern) bathrooms are down poorly-lit stairs, with confusing mirrored walls‚Ä¶.a challenge for the infirm.
One of my fav cheeseburgers ever, and I¬¥m from Argentina where meat is amazing. Service it¬¥s not THE best, though is a good one, but the stars here goes to the food and interior design. Very nice and clean. If you are going during weekends, book a table because it¬¥s always too busy. Perfect cocktails and bar menu too. The barman really knows how to do his job.We also always order the tuna sandwich which is huge and delicious with fresh avocado.
I have nothing bad to say. The style and decor was classy and trendy at the same time. (Check out the bathroom - really cool!) The food was all delicious. I had eggs Benedict which I had never had before and always wanted to try. That plate was 'clean' when I was done with it, ate every last bit. And the in home made donuts were superb. (And I know donuts.) Staff was very polite and helpful even though we were a large unorganized group. I'd love to eat here again.
When native New Yorkers enjoy a restaurant so much they can't wait to return, you have a winner! Three old friend met for a very special birthday and they took reservations. The restaurant features indoor and outdoor areas, and different menus, but we picked the Grille because of its variety and it was a special day. Many other parties were dining including two large ones, but no noise level issues. The food is fantastic and presentation matches food. The servers are not snobs and they let us linger to talk and reminisce. Just a totally delightful experience.
Despite my longing looks at Fig and Olive (across the street), my husband, SIL, BIL and I had lunch at Standard Grill today. Here are my thoughts:Ambiance: Nice, lively atmosphere. Very clean and bright decor. No complaints. Bathrooms are a trip - definitely check them out.Service: Our server was definitely overseeing more than her fair share of tables, and thus it took a while to get her attention when we needed something. Not a big deal though, she was nice. Food: Average to slightly better than average. My Artic Char was nothing special, especially for the price. My husband's Chicken Paillard was also nothing special - he didn't even finish it. My BIL had the lobster sandwich, which he said was good, but he literally ate the entire thing in 2 bites - it was tiny. My SIL had the fish sandwich and really liked it. The Bread Crumb Pudding was absolutely disgusting - we all agreed on that.Prices: Pretty expensive, especially for the quality and quantity.Bottom Line: This place can get away with serving "just okay" food for high prices because it's attached to The Standard. Next time I'm in the area I'll ignore my husband (as I usually do) and head to Fig and Olive which has NEVER been anything but awesome for me.
On a recent trip to NYC, my wife and I walked the High Line and finished up at the south end, about 14th street, where hungry for lunch we found The Standard Grill just under the High Line. It has a white exterior, outdoor and indoor dining and what I would call transitional dining -- inside with wide open doorways. It is slightly upscale, with good and friendly service and very good food. It was busy and my general impression was that it was clean and popular. My wife greatly enjoyed the portobello mushroom burger. With my salad lunch I had a fruity cocktail which I recall was made with rum; very nice. After our long walk, we enjoyed the ambience of a relaxed and leisurely lunch. A perfect stop after walking the High Line.
What happens often in stylish restaurants? Food and service can‚Äôt keep the design level.The interior is modern but could also have been there for 50 years. Europeans might find it dark and loud, but for latter the restaurant is not to blame.We had oysters and raw local blue fish. Extremely fresh. And then a lobster (same) and home made pasta with clams. Savory, spicy, delicious!Desserts are fine, too. Could something be improved? Yes, the bread service. But then this might also be an European perspective 
Found this place after walking the Highline. Lovely sitting out area. Great location although a little noisy with local traffic. Ordered the Standard Burger and my wife had the Beef Salad. Really enjoyable and recommended for lunch.
Not a special place, the locals do not eat here. Feels very touristy, food is avarage and service is distracted.
I do admit that we went here on a Saturday night, which in NYC often means places are packed & staff are under pressure. But The Standard Grill set a new standard for pretentious, lazy and annoying service. The place itself is very cool, great decor and different zones, with the vibe and style you'd expect from The Standard. But the crowd and service...oh my lord, I cannot even. After having a few drinks at the bar waiting for our table (late-ish reservation) we were wowed by the ineptitude of the servers and the overall lack of care shown by the staff. It's obviously a local 'hotspot' but clearly amongst people with little imagination. The saving grace was the food which was excellent. Shame the rest of the experience had totally ruined my appetite by the time it actually arrived.
Went for a lunch and was surprised at the blandness of the menu The food we ordered was just ok and would be fine if the prices reflected the quality. I have to say as a positive note, their french fries were really tasty and fresh. The overall experience felt more of a tourist place rather than where locals would hang out.
Wanted to treat my longtime Manhattan resident friends to a nice dinner. They agreed to meet nearby after my Whitney Museum visit. Our dinner at the Standard Grill met their high standards as he is a gourmet cook. We each ordered a different appetizer, main and dessert. Appetizers were grilled octopus, raw clams, thick asparagus. Mains were fresh trout, braised short ribs, hamburger. Desserts were flan, meringue with rhubarb, a dessert wine. Plus a rose type wine. Each dish had the highest quality ingredients - meat, fish, fruit, vegetables. I ordered trout as I have such fond childhood memories of fishing and having fresh trout on family vacations. This was not the typical very thin white Sierras trout but a wonderfully thick pink trout that exceeded my expectations. Now I have to research which trout this was and find how to buy it. Note: there are two different type dining rooms at the Standard Grill; one bright, sunny, lots of windows with an outdoor patio; the other dark, leather with booths and tables. I requested the dark, leather just because it looked fancier; though if I'd brought my kids I would've requested the sunny. Service was unobtrusively good.
Perfect West Village recipe: Take one sky blue crisp Saturday morning. Walk the High Lineand dismount at The Standard/13th St around 11am. Enter Standard Grill and ask for table in the front if you want sunshine/tourist vibe - table in the rear dining area for more muted, local/metropolitan scene. Survey menu. Be spoiled for choice. Order an immaculately prepared brunch. Wash down with excellent coffee. Be thankful.
- Excellent cooking and a very nice presentation. - Super friendly staff. - Great local wine. - The lamb was perfect cooked. 
After a stroll on the Highline we put our name in for a table for three and went to the hotel's lively Biergarten for a yummy hot Gluhwein. Our wait for a table was exactly the 45 minutes they said it would be and we got one of the coveted booths. Lean, our server was knowledgeable, super friendly and efficient. Everything we ordered was delicious and presented beautifully. It was also a bonus the hotel and restaurants were beautifully decorated for the holiday season! We are locals and consider this place a gem here in NYC!
This is one of our favorites in NYC. As a local it never gets old. Why? Because the food and service are always excellent. The scene is grown and sexy with a tolerable amount of tourists. Luckily they are not the same BNT tourists you will find in many places in this neighborhood. Tonight our double date was perfectly tended to by Creighton. All restaurants should have servers that are this professional, congenial and so well versed in the menu. We ordered most of his recommendations (oysters, lobster, halibut, Apple blunt) and loved every single one of them. Will return to dine here for Christmas and will ask to sit at one of his tables. For those interested, seats on the kitchen are amazing, as is the "last call", essentially a vat of chocolate mouse. Try It!There's Creighton!
Sunday afternoon was packed with locals in an out of the way location. The Standard Grill has a front and rear section, with the front set up diner style and lots of light coming in. Rear section is more intimate with padded semi-circular booths around the perimeter, individual tables and bench style booths in the center. More of a steakhouse look. Noise level was quite high.Despite being jammed, they were able to find me a table in the front section. Server was quick to the table and very polite. Ordered the Standard Grill burger and was amazed by how fast it came out despite the crowd. So hot I burned my fingers on the bacon. Cooked as ordered, medium, to a hot pink center and served with a copper filled bucket of string fries (also hot).Found a new terrific beer, Colette Farmhouse Ale (good substitute for a Belgian white). I was dining solo and the on-duty manager, Dana, came by to chat with me and we had a great conversation. Very personable and made me feel welcome. Despite the huge crowd, she found time to visit. Well done Dana!Price range was $17 for the burger and $7 for the beer. Reasonable for a popular hotel spot.Lunch the following day, Monday, very quiet. Again, good service. Recommend the Maine Lobster roll, served cold on an open-faced roll. Fairly small portion, but very tasty. Price $25
We are not into the high end dining scene, but a local buddy told us we had to try to this place to see where the hip go... we didnt regret it one minute. We were politely sat down in a nice corner where we could people watch as New Yorkers came in for after office drinks and early dinner options. Our food was good, our waiter Nathan was charming and helpful. This was well worth the $100 USD we spent for two of us.
Our dining experience at "The Standard Grille" was nothing short of delightful. For appetizers, the oysters were impeccably fresh, the ceviche burst with vibrant flavors, and the pea shoot salad offered a refreshing balance to start our culinary journey.For the main course, I opted for the burger, and it was a masterpiece of juicy perfection. Dessert was a symphony of sweet sensations. The banoffee pie was a rich, caramel-infused dream, the matcha cheesecake provided a unique and delightful twist, the apple crisp delivered comforting warmth, and the cake was a decadent finale. The service at "The Standard Grille" was impeccable. Highly recommend!
Staying at the standard and was excited to eat here. Wife and I had Saturday brunch. I ordered fresh OJ, espresso, and burger medium with egg. Was served espresso (not over extracted but not exceptional), grapefruit rather than OJ, and a burger that was cooked well done and an egg that was undercooked (whites were runny and not set). For $30 I was incredibly unimpressed - I would have enjoyed a burger from 5 guys far more than what I was served. Wife ordered shakshuka which came out ok. Our waiter was very polished and professional, but not very attentive (not his fault, but he was tending to too many tables to offer timely service, like checking in on us after our meal was served). In sum, food preparation was poor, I was served the incorrect beverage, and the value was very poor for the price. Ambience was nice and service experience was overall positive.
We were very happily surprised with how good snd delicious our evening was at the Standard Grill.. Diamond was our server. Diamond had an authentic elegance, warmth, and grace as she took care of us. We enjoyed fresh, sweet, briny oysters with lemon. Crispy, bracing, shaved sugar snap salad with vinaigrette. Charred, grilled asparagus. And! rich and generous duck confit. The duck tasted like brisket. With a bottle of smooth, mineral Cava. This dinner was delicious and incredibly reasonably priced.
Right underneath the fabulous High-Line, on the Edge of the Meatpacking District, attached to the Standard Hotel. I REALLY love this place! The buzzing vibe is amazing inside and out. Trendy, Glamorous, Cool, Beautiful. The ambiance makes you feel sexy, and the people do too! Everyone is dressed for a night out! If you want to see New Yorkers in full fashion like you imagine New Yorkers (Sex and the City?! Yes!! Mini Fashion Show? Yes!!), this is a great place to people watch! Oh and get a little fancy yourself!! Do it up! Dress to impress!! Have some fun!! Ok but how is the food? SUUUUUUUUUperb!!!! The culinary prowess here is so on point. Same way I describe the people and atmosphere is the way I can describe the food. Exactly what u think a trendy New York City restaurant should be and more. The dishes are absolutely delicious, packed full of flavor, cooked to perfection. A beautiful raw bar, everything is so fresh. The food is American Fare, with an Upscale Flair, but still comforting and inviting! The restaurant staff is very nice and very friendly. Soaccommodating and ready to please! My server, Latina, had such a lovely and pleasant disposition and did her very best to make me happy! She was very interested in how I loved my meal and came to check on me, even though she had many table. She was happy that I was happy! Very attentive and was a pleasure to have serving me! But back to the food, because I need to emphasize... THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS.side note: THE DRINKS are as amazing as the food, the vibe, the people! Creative Fun Cocktails! I'm coming here again as soon as I can! Maybe tomorrow! You should too! See you here!
Echos of old New York in a hip hotel at the south end of the High Line. The hot scene is in the bar in the hotel upstairs but a very pleasant evening can be had in the Grill. With raw bar, seafood and steaks being the specialties, we ordered the three level seafood tower and added the caviar. Split among 4 people, all we had room for afterwards were salads, which were not spectacular, but very good. The seafood was all fresh and there was plenty of it. The cocktails were also good as was the very extensive wine list. We had expert advice from the sommelier who was especially attentive even though we were not ordering expensive bottles. Service was good throughout . Not one of NYC's great restaurants, but a very enjoyable place to spend an evening with friends in a great part of town. Highlights for us were the wine list, seafood. comfy booths and the pennies on the floor!I look forward to coming back in the summer when everything will spill outdoors.
It is a quiet and classy restaurant for wonderful meals. Their use of the fresh ingredients and the way they were prepared and served were very creative. I had dishes I never had before. And I love foods and remember what I had where. We received friendly and very attentive service throughout our meal from Ben, Charles, Nicole, Jordan and Hayden. I recommend The Standard Grill to all food lovers.
Everything was really great, staff, food and drinks. Offers a mix of fresh seafood and a variety of mains too, great feel to the place too.
I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this restaurant. Beautiful entry and decor that reminds me of a Paris cafe from the 1930‚Äôs. Eating at the bar was perfect and our waiters were the best. The food was a little pricey ($16 for avocado toast for brunch) but it was all fresh, nice size portions and the brunch cocktails were unique and satisfying. I‚Äôm definitely going back. 
On a trip back to NYC, my fianc√© and I went to the Standard Grill & sat outside. He was efficient, friendly & knowledgeable on the menu. He gave off great vibes, never pushy and we enjoyed all of our food. When our side order of fries were a tad cold, he brought over a fresh order without even having to ask! Francisco is a great server! Thanks! 
Lovely restaurant, open and airy with a nice selection of fresh, well-prepared dishes and a wide variety of specialty cocktails and wines.
On walking in you are greeted by a friendly seater as this place is very popular would highly recommend booking in advance. The service is excellent and top ups if drinks is very seamless. The food is fantastic with fresh seafood as a main draw. I started with a prawn cocktail which is one of the best I‚Äôve ever eaten. Followed by a New York strip which was very tasty. One draw back was the fries as they were overly salty and not enjoyable to want to eat. Overall very good. The bathrooms have to be checked out as being quite novel. Will be coming back again for sure as the Meat Packing area is a very trendy place to be.
We‚Äôve been here a few time and I‚Äôve always enjoyed the food and the vibe. This time, we sat in the dining room - the penny ‚Äútiled‚Äù floor, subway tiled arched ceiling, soft banquets and park bench seats bridge this space beautifully with the patio/beer garden / ice rink (depending upon when you visit) and the bright cheery cafe space. You cannot go wrong with any of their fresh juices, beautiful fruit salads, crazy thick French toast, avocado toast, Eggs Benedict, and yummy breakfast potatoes. I also love to get oysters here with a nice glass of champagne. The Standard Grill is a perfect place to treat yourself before or after your stroll on the adjacent high line.
Fun stop on a Sunday after we had been to the Chelsea Market. We sat at the bar. The Bloody Mary with shrimp was a meal itself. We also had a selection of oysters which were fresh and delicious. This is an upscale trendy place. A little pricey, but it is NYC. The bartenders were friendly and provided excellent service. The five of us really enjoyed ourselves.
My best friends and I hadn‚Äôt done a paint the town red kind of night in such a long time but we finally got together and we are so lucky to have chosen The Standard to kick things off. We arrived early and got drinks at the bar before our reservation and were then promptly seated. Annalise was our server and when I tell you this woman worked for us, my god did she hustle. Incredibly knowledgeable, prompt and entertaining, she is what elevated our time from just a good time out to one for the memory books. Heck, I wish I could invite her out the next time we go.As for food, we were all really happy with our selections, we shared the Caesar salad and I got the king crab linguine, which Annalise was able to ensure could be made without the mint. I annihilated the whole plate. My friends all got the scallops and I had a bite of theirs and it was delicious as well, that perfect melt in your mouthness. We had a few glasses of wine and were also treated to a round of champagne from a nearby table of French guys who Annalise assured us they weren‚Äôt creepy.We were sad our night had to change spaces from the standard because we really enjoyed our time there and Annalise made us feel like a million bucks. 
Incredible food, lovely ambience, and excellent service. I came here this past weekend to celebrate my birthday with a friend, a place we were eager to return to as we had not been back to since before the pandemic. Everything seemed better than it was before then but most especially was our experience with the amazing staff. From the moment we entered the restaurant until we left, we were looked after by Maxwell with the utmost care, attention and professionalism. Even above and beyond that, he was engaging and serenaded me with the Happy Birthday Song (yes, serenaded, and beautifully done might I add!) clearly showing how much he cares about each and every patron's entire dining experience. The Standard is the whole package and you will leave with your appetite sated and hearts full.
Gr8 place mgmt done gr8 food great drinks whole place locations table love this place ty. Dav Vic tell us about BEST restaurant 
We arrived for brunch at 11.15 and were informed that breakfast finishes at 11.30 but last orders at 11.20. We opted for lunch instead. I had the lamb bacon and harrissa sandwich it repeated on me the whole day. Another member of our party had the fish taco sandwich made with "hockey" which ended up being Hake. Fish was over cooked. Service was great to start but the moment the food was delivered that's where it needed. No more drinks were offered and table sat dirty for ages before being cleaned. 
I'd walked past this restaurant the previous day & thought it looked interesting. Booked to take two old friends & my daughter for lunch without knowing too much about it. Could not have been better. We sat inside at the front. The cocktails were fantastic. The menu isn't huge but our food was delicious. We had a lovely waiter who was fun & attentive & very helpful to me as I have Coeliac disease. Could not have been happier with the whole experience & highly recommend this restaurant. You can come out & walk the Highline straight afterwards.
The first cold snap of our recent stay in Manhattan came on New Years' Eve. We had been wandering the streets hat and scarfless during the first few days of our stay (me feeling mildly cheated, there's nothing like a couple of atmospherically wintry days tramping around New York City) but the last day of the year brought Jack Frost with it. We weren't up for late night reveling this year but still had to eat. We made a booking for 8 and watched the kids skating on the rink outside before we headed in from the cold. We were ushered to a cosy nook in a corner and ordered a bottle of white while we looked at the menu, which was extensive. One of my favourite things when I travel is reading menus and appreciating the incredibly vast range of ingredients, and ones that haven't yet made their way onto the menus at home. At The Standard Grill, you can order from the raw bar (oysters, clams, caviar, lobster) for starters, platters of salumi, cheese and shellfish are also on the menu. Appetizers and mains have a variety of meat, fish and vegetarian dishes. We decided on a whole chicken for two with beans and crispy potatoes. It was the cosy dinner we would have made had we stayed in. The service was attentive, waiters constantly filling up water and checking to see if all was well at our table. The restaurant started to get buzzier and busier as we got through our meal with New Years' Eve party goers stopping by for drinks at the bar. The atmosphere was festive and fun. The food was excellent, tasty and nourishing and just what we wanted to eat on a cold December night. There was so much of it, we took our leftovers home with us. We passed on dessert and coffee and headed off, our last meal of the year was a really good one.
We heard about this place all the way from the UK. Recommended by a friend - what a great little place this was! I ordered the New York strip med-rare, which hands down was the BEST cooked steak I ever had. My boyfriend ordered the special, because even the effort that goes into the waiters descriptions of the specials was mouth-watering. Food reasonable price, but be ready to pay for the wine. But, the whole experience was worth the bill total! Constant hands on service, but with no interference to you or your evening. I really recommend this restaurant, and should I return to New York, this will be top of my list to eat there again!
This restaurant was awesome. The atmosphere was lively and exciting. The food was to die for; I ordered the NY Strip and it was fantastic. Our waiter, Creighton, was spectacular and made our experience that much better. We will definitely be coming back for the whole experience!! 
We'd eaten here before - but indoors. This time we were seated in the garden patio area and the whole evening was wonderful. Our waiter, Creighton, was enthusiastic and knowledgable. The food was spectacular. If you're lucky enough to eat there on Thursday the beef short-rib special is NOT to be missed. We were sending our daughter off to London and she said it was the prettiest place she'd ever eaten.
It was our first night in NYC and our friend made reservations at the Standard. We arrived and were seated in the middle of a very crowded, loud restaurant. This was not a problem at all, simply an observation for those perhaps seeking a more intimate dinner. Our waiter was friendly at first, offering suggestions for drinks and appetizers. I got the grilled octopus, which was the one redeeming part of the evening. It was downhill after that. The entrees took an obscene amount of time to arrive. A party of six at a table to our right arrived at least 20 minutes after us and all had their food before we got ours. And our waiter didn't come to tell us what was happening until much later. He informed us that the kitchen had gotten backed up and missed our ticket and that they were finishing everything up. It seemed more likely that he simply forgot to put the order in and now everything was being rushed. So we waited another 20 minutes and our food arrived. And the steak that was ordered medium came raw - like cold in the middle. It might as well have been tartare. When our waiter returned after a while to check on us, we should him the raw steak. He seemed more annoyed than anything, and offered to have them recook what was left. Needless to say we didn't wait to wait another hour, so we declined and said not to worry about it. He left, and we discussed whether we wanted to try dessert or not. We will all still hungry, and decided why not, its our first night out in the city. But our waiter was nowhere to be found. One of the bus boys came to refill our drinks, and I asked him if he wouldn't mind bringing a dessert menu. He obliged, and then vanished to whatever hole our waiter vanished to. We saw our waiter again before we ever saw the busboy, so we simply asked for our check. Thankfully, the rare steak was left off the check, but on the whole it was a really terrible start to our week in the city. Thankfully, other restaurants redeemed the week for us. Maybe we just got a waiter having a rough night, I don't know.
Good FoodMy wife met four of our out of town friends met here for dinner. Rene was our efficient and very capable waitress on this Thursday night.I had the short ribs that was cooked to perfection. Melt in you mouth. My wife shared the rib eye for two. They had asked for medium but it came out rare. Unfortunately, sending it back to the kitchen didn't help. It came back rare. Management did removed the charge from our bill. Two other friends shared their "World" whole famous chicken. It was moist and tender. My guess it was probably brined. The last diner had the tip steak. Unfortunately it too was under cooked.All and all it was a good night out with friends. The only negative comment is that the kitchen needs to pay closer attention to the meat requests.With that said I would come here one mire time. 
Had the pleasure of visiting this establishment yesterday, the food was great, we had the roasted whole chicken for too, creamed spinach, and 1/2 dozen oysters. I tried a drink called the penny drop (Great!!!!!!) overall everything was perfect. Word to the wise, make a reservation before coming, unless you'll be like us and have to wait by the bar for about 20 mins
I have been here before for a post shopping escapade cocktail and found it charming. This time around....for a business dinner. Service was absolutely wonderful. The food was also excellent. We started with a cheese and salumi platter, mini caesar salad, and wonderful entrees including grilled scallops, steak with chimichurri sauce, whole roasted chicken with sides of brussel sprouts, grilled potatoes, etc. A great dessert is the brownie in the small cast iron skillet. The seafood choices look spectacular. I would encourage you to try the seafood options or just some simple oysters on the half-shell. The dress code is casual/business casual. The location is perfect! Had a great time!!We had a large dinner party and despite the main circuit breaker going out in the middle of our meal, the workers were very professional and handled the situation well. For addition fun head out to the biergarten next door for a night of casual drinking and ping pong!
We had a ball - great food & great atmosphere - it was a joy, very cool spot. We stayed at the Standard as part of the trip - it was a blast the whole time. The food was first class - my wife had the lamb & it was awesome, I had the linguini and it was excellent too 
While out in Manhattan visiting family we decided to book at the standard grill. Not impressed at all with the service and the attitude some waiters had. Plus food not as good as expected. Left feeling something was missing from the whole experience
We enjoy sitting at the bar, before taking a table. The drink are fun and well crafted. It can be quite busy, and service can be slow but mostly friendly. Fresh seafood, farm to table. In the pasted we have had great whole trout, huge shrimp with corn and Mexican aioli, raw clams.
The Standard Grill is always a wonderful experience! Do not pass on the brilliant cocktail list! The fresh, farm to table menu is truly wonderful--There is something for everyone..At my table we had a vegan, someone that was gluten-free and several foodies like myself..EVERYONE was happy and had a great experience. Excellent service as always. Take a stroll along the High Line..you are a few steps away..
What a disappointment. Went for a late weekend brunch and our table had the burger, farm breakfast, Cobb salad and huevos rancheros, so a pretty varied order overall. Nothing was terrible but nothing was better than just OK, which shouldn't be the case at a place like this. There is too much exceptional food in New York to eat boring and bland dishes. Spend your money elsewhere.
Located in the meatpacking district, the Standard Grill features a farm to table menu. The outdoor section is set under an attractive pergola. The food is quite good-- not very original but tasty. The waitstaff is very attentive. After 10, this spot gets hopping!!
We loved this restaurant. Great selection of tasty food, much "farm-to-table". They have the most amazing and attentive staff. We loved it, and would highly recommend it !
To whom it may concern;I had a wonderful time at your establishment, and Glenn, our server, was incredibly helpful, insightful and a pure delight.He is a great addition to your team and we thoroughly enjoyed his attentive service. We absolutely enjoyed the meal suggested by Glenn, and your team, as well as your Somalier's, whose name I cannot remember at the moment, wine suggestions. We do look forward to returning to your establishment again because of Glenn, and you're wonderful team's attentive and joyful service.Till the next time. Sincerely,David F Zambrana
This place is very impressive from the outset. Beautiful old dark and rich decor, with mood lighting and beautiful furniture. The food was pretty impressive too, and the wine list extensive... unfortunately, the service does not match the place. I had a standoff-ish waitress who rolled her eyes when I said I was gluten-free but wanted to have an option with potatoes. She basically said they couldn't do any potatoes without gluten.... which I know for a high-end restaurant is pure BS. How about just boiling or roasting them?! She went off to chat to her superior who came back and said 'this one time we will make an exception, ok?' and made me feel like the idiot for asking for it. Not good. Then after we got served the main, the service went further downhill because no-one bothered to come back and collect plates or see if we wanted dessert. So we moved on somewhere else for dessert and obviously didn't leave much of a tip. Disappointing. I'd book elsewhere i this great area.
My husband and I have been to many restuarants in NYC over the last 15 years, but this is by far our most memorable experience. Our waiter Creighton guided us through an amazing dining experience. There was not one item served that was not pure excellence. Amazing melt in your mouth short rib special (Thurs only) and perfectly flavored bourbon glazed pork chops. I will be recommending this place to everyone I possibly can. Perfect romantic location. I just want to end with our gratitude to Creighton who delivered the most amazinng dining experience. He truly has a passion for delighting his guests and a passion for the amazing food The Standard services.
Such an amazing, delicious, and warm experience. The food and service was excellent ‚Äî Diamond and Chris were so personable, warm, and attentive. They truly were the cherry on top of our delicious meal.The cocktails were divine. My boyfriend got a meatpacking Manhattan, and I got the Naked and Almost Famous. I highly recommend this one! So smooth and perfectly balanced.For food, we began with the oyster, grilled prawns, and chicken pate, and finished with the duck and New York strip steak. The steak was a personal favorite of mine ‚Äî the steak was cooked perfectly. The fries here are the best I‚Äôve had in New York ‚Äî were perfectly crisped and salty. Such a delicious meal.The desserts here were increeeddible. The banana pudding and apple crumb dessert were out of this world, and also made me think of my own parent‚Äôs cooking, but with elevated ingredients and presentation. Superb. All in all such an amazing first time experience, one that I can not wait to repeat and share with more friends and loved ones.
It has been a while since I have been to Standard Grill and yesterday reminded what a gem this restaurant is. We were warmly welcome by the host and went to the bar for a pre dinner cocktails. The bartender suggestion were fantastic, the cocktails were well balanced, t too sweet and very refreshing.. after our experience at the bar, we seated at nice booth and our server was knowledgeable, attentive and funny. The crudo and chicken liver were delicious and the lobster pasta and duck are a must. The desserts were so yummy! Needless to say, date night was a huge success. Thank you to the amazing team at The Standard grill!
They make a perfect negroni, have a diverse wine list and really interesting menu.My yellowfin tuna tartar was very well balanced with cilantro and lime...my short rib rage homemade pasta and husbands Black Sea bass was excellent!Dinner from cocktails through dessert was exceptional. Delicious.
We were looking forward to having dinner at The Standard Grill, which we assumed must be good due to the fact that it forms part of the five star hotel.The food itself was delicious; the grilled octopus starter was tender and flavourful and not at all chewy. The rib-eye main course was cooked to perfection, as was the mixed green vegetables and pan fried potatoes. It was evident that the cocktails were made by competent mixologists as their flavours balanced one another wonderfully. Although the service started off being five star (the friendly, professional hostess managed to secure us a table outside), it soon diminished to something you'd expect at a lesser establishment. The clumsy waiter broke basic service rules by repeatedly reaching over the table, not knowing anything about the wine selection and shrugging his shoulders when told the bread was stale (it most definitely was!). We received some freshly prepared bread, but this wasn't enough to recover from the unrefined service we experienced.With so many other mid-high priced eateries in the city offering great service as well as food, there's no reason for me to return to The Standard Grill. Disappointing doesn't cover it.
We've been going to the Standard Grill Plaza outside on the green on Wed/ Thur nights when they have Drag Trivia.. really a fun night had by all! Emcee'd by Ru Paul Drag Race stars - we order cocktails and dinner and partake in a really fun night out!! Our table even won a round!! We got prizes and a round of drinks! Food and cocktails are always delicious - will be going back again and again! Part of the fun of NYC Summers!!
The location is great, right below the High Line not far away from Chelsea Market, ideal for taking some rest after touring around. The burger is very nice, good bacon, although the pickle is a bit tasteless. The green curry mussel is quite special to me and turn out to be very nice. The fries are AMAZING, probably the best among all things we took. I can't comment much on the drink - we took only a beer and coke. Service is quick and price is reasonable. Overall I'm very happy with it. 
We arrived at noon, before the lunch rush but it still took the servers over 20 minutes to take our order, 45 minutes before bread was brought to the table. So many servers there but we felt virtually ignored. The food was okay but over-priced. My side of creamed greens came out tepid, but the seared tuna was better. But the most annoying thing was that the servers kept bumping into me. Inexcusable really. Poor layout. Our table server spilled drops of a soft drink on my entree as they reached over the table. Another handed a heavy play to my elderly mother in law, rather than plaint it on the table, she almost dropped it. Will not be returning.
Nothing feels more wonderful than losing one's self in the lap of English luxury mixed with a downtown artsy note. The omelettes are sumptuous and easy to linger over as are all of the traditional Sunday comfort foods. Having the ability to throw tradition to the wind and opt for a tall green juice makes the Grill all the more " chill. " Thanks to the wonderful staff for keeping glasses filled, plates moving at a relaxed pace and always serving with smiles. 
The standard offered a complimentary dinner for residents affected by the pressure cooker bomb in Chelsea. Workers and wait staff were very nice. Food was okay. The trout was a tad under-cooked for my taste, and some of the greens were soggy. Nice, lively ambiance was almost ruined by some of their rich, young rude clientele. If you like mingling with the young, rich, set- this is the place for you; just be prepared for some rude patrons and OK food.
We had a table outside which was very nice. The place is quite pricy but the food was good. I initially wanted the lamb, but it turned out they were out of that which I think they should have told us when they handed out the menus. I therefore had a New York Strip which was cooked a bit too much (I ordered medium rare, but got a medium). The potatoes were nice and so were the baked greens. The corn was disappointing. At this level price wise I think they should serve you bread and butter while you wait for your food.
We walked the Highline in New York and Google Maps found this place to eat. Any restaurant that calls itself a "Grill" in New York must be good...In short, after the amount of beef we had already eaten we opted for the Salmon, which was delicious as were the fries and creamed greens.The service was poor though. We asked a waiter for a table and he just nodded in the direction of another waiter who in turn nodded towards the front desk, where we were eventually seated. Although it was in the 80s they had the outdoor heaters on. After asking twice if they could be turned off, they eventually told us they couldn't. Other customers were also complaining about the heat so we were not alone.So the food was good, but the staff were arrogant and unhelpful.
We had lunch at The Standard Grill. My son's burger was charred and burnt completely black. We complained, and they brought a new one that was just as burnt, and so was the bun. Our White Wine (Sancerre) was served in very small glasses that could have been for port or sherry, but the waitress did change the glasses to bigger ones. We asked not to have any chili due to allergy, but the side order - a vegetable-plate - was nontheless sprayed with red and green chili, so the waitress had to take it back and get us another. All in all the staff wasn't very professional, and we didn't even get a refund for the Black burger. McDonald's had been a better choice...
I may be the last person to go to the hip Standard Grill at the Standard Hotel beneath the Highline and near the Whitney. We went for lunch at noon on a weekday and there were many choices of places to sit. We sat inside near the front window. I ordered a regular salad (delicious light dressing) and shared it with my friend. It was enough to share as an appetizer. My friend had the yogurt chicken and I had the veggie burger. The burger was delicious and I skipped the bun and fries (believe me I could have eaten the entire thing but I am trying to loose some weight) I really was far happier with the menu than I thought. Clams and oysters looked fresh and delicious and at the same time the burger seemed hearty and tempting. I had a fruit plate for dessert and it was beautifully presented with apples, bananas, oranges, grapes and berries. My friend tried the green tea baked alaska . It was still frozen when served but she finished it happily. The staff all came to the table for feedback as it was new on the menu. We moved tables for dessert because we were cold in the front. I liked the back room, very clubby with booths. There were some celebrities and happily some old friends. The staff could not have been nicer and we were well taken care of the entire time. The only drawback might be on the weekends when it is packed and probably noisier. I will definitely return and I would hang out here if I lived downtown.
i can recommend the steak and eggs breakfast plus any of the waffles or pancakes. the green juice is uber healthy and the grilled chicken is solid good hearty food. 
The Standard was a nice surprise to us - the ribeye to share was excellent, and the side mushrooms were as well. Our friend's salmon was great, too. The only disappointment were the side greens. Service pays attention and is very friendly. Definitely recommended! Make sure to book a table in advance!
This was by far the best food we had whilst staying in NYC. Staff were really good, & I got special attention because it was my birthday. Complimentary glasses of champagne & desserts. Felt like VIP's ! The lamb was delicious & the side dish of greens just stunning. Wish we didn't live on the other side of the Atlantic or we would be back every week! Thank you for making us feel so welcome.
I give this a four for the overall experience, not rating the food alone. This restaurant makes beautiful looking pizzas with fresh ingredients. The flavors are simple and mild, so the taste of each ingredient shines. The pizza crust is delightfully soft and chewy, even the gluten free one. The gluten free crust was more moist in the center than I prefer, but I expected it to be that way since that is the nature of this type of dough. I appreciated the inviting atmosphere, cleanliness of the restaurant, and the pleasant staff.
With the current health crisis, we had to celebrate my godmother‚Äôs 83rd birthday at home and order in. Based on the reviews, we ordered from Sottocasa and were more than willing to pick it up as we are 10 blocks out of the delivery radius. When I called, Mateo the owner answered and he was more than accommodating as he said they will deliver to us! The pizzas were delicious! (And I‚Äôm a very critical native New York pizza connoisseur.) The ingredients are so fresh and the seasoning is perfection! These are thin individual pizzas that are cooked to perfection. To top it off, because I had mentioned it was my godmother‚Äôs birthday, an individual tiramisu with a candle was wrapped in its own bag with Happy Birthday written on it, An absolute delight! I‚Äôm already telling my friends to support this jewel in the heart of Harlem. Try it, you will not regret it!
This pizzeria serves tasty Neapolitan pizza with diverse toppings in a cozy setting. The staff is friendly, and the Ceci salad and leopard pizza are outstanding. The skilled pizzaioli ensure a clean environment, and the convenient location offers ample seating.
Really good italian pizza! Tasty, crispy and yummy! The owner is italian. The staff is friendly and helpful. The place is clean and cozy!
Ok I admit I‚Äôm the worst kind of pizza geek. I imported a pizza oven from Italy that is in my backyard. That being said this place was great. We started with a Ceci (garbanzo bean) salad with tuna and capers and lemon that can only be described as clean and fresh and amazing. Complimenting the bean salad was a delightful leopard pizza. The crust was perfect, sauce light and cheese balanced. One of the best pizzas in the States. Support this place!
The food was excellent the pizzaioli has a lot of experience and they worked so well and they were very clean, the manager and the waiters were very patient and very professional and very attentive to the clients and the bathrooms are very clean.
We found this establishment through TripAdvisor, which has it listed as one of the best pizza places in NYC. If I could, I would give this restaurant an even higher rating than "Excellent"!Located in Harlem, this restaurant offers authentic Italian cuisine; the owner is actually from Italy, and it shows in the menu options and the food! We started off with a focaccia and olives appetizer, along with an imported Italian beer. Both were delicious! We decided to order the taleggio pizza, which consisted of three different cheeses topped with prosciutto. This was the most delicious pizza I've ever had! The prosciutto was very tender and not too salty, and the cheese blend was super tasty! For dessert, my husband enjoyed the tiramisu while I had the tartufo, which was chocolate ice cream molded around vanilla bean ice cream and topped with cocoa powder, nutella, and espresso grounds. YUM!Aside from the wonderful food, the wait staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The interior decor was very cozy, and the restaurant was very clean. One of the highlights of our trip to NYC! Would recommend this restaurant to anybody!
I'm Italian and I can tell you for sure that these guys know hot to make REAL italian pizza, with real fresh original ingredients that taste exactly as in Italy.Great setting very clean and fascinating and owners and waiters are very friendly. There is only one thing which could be improved: desserts are very tasty, specially the tiramisu' but they are too expensive.
I‚Äôm from Italy (really) and I really like good tasty but not to heavy pizza. Now this is the place! In addition outstanding service, familiar but not extravagant, warm, cordial with cosy and very nicely decorated ambient, ideal for both couples or for family gatherings. Service is perfect and all areas of the restaurant are clean and tidy. You can see that is properly run and always under the control of the owners who wore me welcome you at any occasion.
I was in NY bringing my son back to school and we stopped here to eat, 4 of us. We started with the beet salad and the spinach salad. Both were fresh and excellent. We then ordered 2 pies, a Margherita Pizza and the Burrata Pizza (which they only do Fri-Sunday). Both were excellent. I've eaten A LOT of pizza over the years and the pizzas we enjoyed are really the best Neapolitan Pizza's I've had. So good, in fact, we ordered a 3rd pizza, the Aglio Olio. I can't say enough good things. The place was clean, great atmosphere and a very friendly staff. Definitely worth the trip if you're uptown anywhere.
Being Italian I'm always a bit suspicious when I have Pizza outside Italy. Sottocasa was really a nice surprise!Excellent Pizza, prepared with high quality ingredients.We were a group of 6, and everybody was extremely satisfied, I has a pizza margherita. Staff nice and friendly with attention at every small details, nice atmosphere, super clean!And don't forget to try the"tiramisu"
The pizza is the best you will ever put in your mouth. The service is impeccable and the restaurant itself is so clean and nice!
Excellent service, excellent recommendations, excellent pizza and tiramisu. All in all an awesome evening and would frequent often if we were local.
Stayed on my own for a few weeks locally so ate in here a few times at the bar - the best ever.... Pizza, Chianti and the deserts all great - great staff and atmosphere !!!
Great pizza and fast service. Small local business with walking distance from our hotel. Reasonably priced
Even outside it looks lovely- lots of fairy lights and plants by the entrance. We were greeted straight away and had the voice between a high or low table. The lighting was just right, the music too. We were seated in the middle of the restaurant surrounded by local works of art, which were all available to buy.Our waitress was faultless, quickly taking our wine and pizza order. We weren‚Äôt kept waiting long for our meal. Both our pizzas were sublime! We ordered a bottle of wine to go with it and that was reasonable yet agreeable drinking.Our desserts were out of this world! The chocolate tartufo was out of this world good. We‚Äôll definitely be back! 
From the first moment to the last, our visit to Sottocasa Pizzeria in Harlem was special! From the warm welcome of the owner and his wife, the efficient and curteous staff, to the authentic pizzas cooked in a REAL wood burning oven - in the city!!!The icing on the cake, if you like, came in the form of the exquisite cannoli at the end. The shells are made locally and filled with a cream that instantly takes your taste buds straight to Southern Italy.No wonder they are ranked so high on TA. Well earned. Hope to come back again soon.
No doubt this place has come to stay! Run by lovely hosts Matteo & Elena, it‚Äôs just wonderful to see how they make everyone feel welcome and special. As a frequent visitor to NY, I always make time to pop in to Sottocasa in Harlem to say hi and to taste one of their amazing pizzas! The food is authentic and excellent, the good selection of wines are carefully selected by the hosts, the vibe and atmosphere is so warm and friendly. It truly stands out in the jungle of restaurants in NY. Here everyone is welcome. Always busy, you can tell this restaurant is welcomed by the locals, and the way everyone is greeted. It‚Äôs a great place for families, for couples and perfect for solo visitors, like myself. Observing the way customers are being greeted, the warmness, the kindness, the laughter, and how many regular customers who visit, often several times √† week, the hosts has made this establishment in to a hugely popular neighbourhood-place to meet. Only 10 minutes in an Uber from my hotel in Midtown - it‚Äôs on my top priority list whenever I visit NY! 
Possibly the best pizza I've ever eaten. Incredible dough, fresh, hot, cooked in a wood-fired pizza oven. Excellent service too. A hidden gem in Harlem. Perfect. 
Delicious pizza ,tomato sauce so fresh .Wonderful personal service and extremely welcoming.See you soon, guys
